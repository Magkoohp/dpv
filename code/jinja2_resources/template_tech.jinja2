  <section id="abstract">
    <p>The [[[DPV]]] provides a rich taxonomy of concepts which includes <i>Technology</i>. While it enables expression of how some technology is applied within the context of personal data and its processing, there is a need for further specific details regarding technologies, their management, and relevance to actual real-world tools and systems. TECH provides such concepts associated with Technologies as an extension to DPV concepts.</p>
    <p>The namespace for terms in tech is <a href="http://w3id.org/dpv/tech#"><code>https://w3id.org/dpv/tech#</code></a><br/>
      The suggested prefix for the namespace is <code>tech</code><br/>
      The TECH vocabulary and its documentation is available on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <section id="vocab-actors">
    <h2>Actors involved in Technologies</h2>
    <p>To specify the specific actors and their roles in the context of technologies, [=Actor=] is provided along with the following specific roles as its subtypes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[=Developer=] and [=hasDeveloper=] specifies who develops or has developed the technology.</li>
      <li>[=Provider=] and [=hasProvider=] specifies who provides the technology. This could be the same entity as developer, or a different one - such as when the technology is repackaged or modified before provision.</li>
      <li>[=User=] and [=hasUser=] specifies who uses or is the user for the technology. Note that while this refers to <i>users</i> in the technical sense of the term, such users may or may not be <i>data subjects</i>. For example, a technology used by an immigration officer has that officer as the user, rather than the immigrating person. To be more explicit, <i>technology user</i> and <i>whom the technology is used on</i> are two different criterias. See distinction below.</li>
      <li>[=Subject=] and [=hasSubject=] is the <i>subject</i> of the technology i.e. whom the technology is used on or subjected to. This may be directly (e.g. person within a CCTV camera's vision) or indirectly (e.g. person whose details were used as training data). What is considered a subject may be contextually dependant on the nature and scope of the technology as well as its application. In the future, we may separate this concept for further distinction between direct and indirect subjects (or use alternate terms) - if such categorisation is deemed beneficial in the description of individuals subjected to technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note, that the technology actor concepts are based on the EU's proposal for AI reguation (i.e. AI ACT) and its corresponding concepts (e.g. AI Provider, AI Developer). Rather than limiting such concepts for "AI", we have expanded upon their intended meaning to encompass any technology. The concepts from the AI ACT can thus be modelled as subtypes of these.</p>

    <h2>Provision of Technology</h2>
    <p>The provision of technology can happen via the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[=System=], [=Component=], and [=Algorithmic=] - that indicate whether the technology is provided as a system (e.g. stand alone), is intended to be used as a component in another system, or is algorithmic (e.g. implementation of a particular method).</li>
      <li>[=Service=], [=Goods=], [=Product=], and [=Subscription=] - that provide an indication of whether the technology is service (e.g. implemented to function as a service), or is a product or a subscription (e.g. provided by a vendor).</li>
      <li>[=FixedUse=] indicates whether the technology has limitations of use e.g. specific number of application or single application, or those related to scale or scope. For example, a single use identifier or a one time scan for vulnerabilities.</li>
