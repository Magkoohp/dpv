  </figure>
  <p>DPVâ€™s taxonomy of purposes is used to represent the goal or reason associated with processing of personal data and use of technologies. For this, purposes are organised within DPV based on several factors such as: management functions related to information (e.g. records, account, finance), fulfilment of objectives (e.g. delivery of goods), providing goods and services (e.g. service provision), intended benefits (e.g. optimisations for service provider or consumer), and legal compliance.</p>

  <p>DPV provides a taxonomy of Purpose <i>instances</i> for use with [=hasPurpose=] relation. In addition, DPV also defines the concept [=Sector=] (associated using [=hasSector=]) to indicate a contextual interpretation of the purpose within a specified sector.</p>

  <section id="desc-purpose-guidelines">
    <h2>Guidelines on Purposes</h2>
    <p>DPV's purpose taxonomy enables expressing the <i>category</i> of purpose i.e the broader goal or reason. To enable accurate representation of purposes, we recommend further describing the purposes in a contextual manner where relevant. For example, the concept [=Marketing=] refers to the broad purpose of 'marketing', which may not be sufficient to represent information such as the marketing is about a specific campaign associated with the holiday season. Such additional details are necessary to understand where the 'initial' purpose may differ with 'subsequent' purposes of data. For example, if consent was given only for the use of personal data for marketing during holiday seasons, other non-holiday marketing purposes would not be compatible with it. Additional details can be added to DPV purposes by two methods: (1) extending the DPV taxonomy; and (2) adding annotations containing human-readable descriptions. We recommend always using (2), and using (1) where necessary or relevant.</p>
    <p>To enable the accurate representations of purposes, we also recommend choosing the most relevant or closest concept from purpose taxonomy so that the purpose is as specific as possible. For example, choosing [=ProvidePersonalisedRecommendations=] instead of [=Personalisation=] allows communicating that the personalisation is of a specific kind and that other kinds of personalisations such as for UI/UX or advertising are not part of this purpose.</p>

  <section id="desc-service-provision">
    <h2>Service Provision</h2>
    <p>For purposes associated with [=ServiceProvision=], DPV provides concepts such as [=PaymentManagement=], [=ServiceOptimisation=], and [=ServiceRegistration=] amongst others. To associate these with services, the `Service` concept can be used similar to how `Process` is used to structure related information together. In this manner, a service can be expressed in terms of the different purposes and processes it contains - which may have their own separate legal basis.</p>
    {{ example_aside('dex:E0041') }}
   </section>

  <section id="desc-legal-obligation">
    <h2>Legal Obligation/Compliance</h2>
    <p>To express the purpose is associated with a legal obligation or a requirement for compliance such as in a contract, the concept [=FulfilmentOfObligation=] is provided with further concepts [=FulfilmentOfContractualObligation=], [=LegalCompliance=], and [=ProtectionOfIPR=]. When such purposes are required by law i.e. their implementation is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, the legal basis `LegalObligation` should be used along with details of the law and the obligation.</p>

    <h2>Sector of Operation</h2>
    <p>To indicate the purpose is associated with a specific sector or domain of operation, the concept [=Sector=] and relation [=hasSector=] can be used. Sectors can be expressed using normative taxonomies such as [[[NACE]]] for EU, [[[NAICS]]] for USA, [[[ISIC]]] for UN, or [[[GICS]]]. The EU maintains a mapping between [[NACE]] and [[NAICS]] as [[[NACE-NAICS]]]. Note that NACE has been updated from v2 to v2.1 - <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-eurostat-news/w/wdn-20230210-1">see more details</a>.</p>
