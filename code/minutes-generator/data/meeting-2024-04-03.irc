20:10:04 <harsh> Topic: AI Act 
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/106 -> Issue 106 Propose concepts from the AI Act (by coolharsh55)
20:10:04 <ghurlbot> https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/126 -> Issue 126  AI Extension to provide AI-specific concepts (by coolharsh55)
20:10:04 <harsh> delaram: ready to publish the existing work as a draft while it is continued to be refined
20:10:04 <harsh> harsh: should we continue with the tech and ai as separate extensions?
20:10:04 <harsh> delaram: yes, I see a large set of concepts for AI so a separate extension would be better
20:10:04 <harsh> paul: there is also merit from a 'marketing' perspectives to make this attractive and people may want to go straight to the AI concepts with this
20:10:04 <harsh> \ after discussion, the group agreed to make the Tech and AI extensions separate.
20:10:04 <harsh> Topic: Biometrics
20:10:04 <harsh> georg: should we extend the term biometric with more specific terms? see post https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georg-philip-krog-a2a278104_ai-act-and-biometric-categorisation-systems-activity-7180921510516170752-6LZu
20:10:04 <harsh> harsh: we have biometrics in personal data - so all extensions should go there so that if any system is using any of the sub-categories then it should be a biometric system
20:10:04 <harsh> georg: so the specific question is whether we keep only the term 'biometric' or do we go for more specific ones?
20:10:04 <harsh> delaram: is the objective to assist in understanding whether the system is using biometric data?
20:10:04 <harsh> georg: it is about having a list of biometrics as the definition is not clear and there may be lots of different concepts that come under biometric
20:10:04 <harsh> paul: GDPR biometric dataâ€™ means personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data;
20:10:04 <harsh> harsh: https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:tr:24741:ed-2:v1:en ISO standard about biometrics has broad categories we can use
20:10:04 <harsh> harsh: The JTC1/SC37 working group has many standards on biometrics https://www.iso.org/committee/313770/x/catalogue/p/1/u/1/w/0/d/0

20:10:04 <harsh> delaram: AI Act Annex III has high-risk categorisation based on biometrics - see clause 1
20:10:04 <harsh> \ after discussion, the group agreed to add these to personal data extension as they are useful. For starting with the work, only the broad categories (e.g. from ISO) should be considered. The rest will then be added as needed.
20:10:04 <harsh> Topic: CJEU TOMs case
20:10:04 <harsh> georg: georg: CJEU case on data processors to have clear documentation of TOMs https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=280623&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1 Therefore its important for DPV to have a good list of TOMs for processors and controllers. Also we agreed to expand on these with Legal in additional to Tech/Org measures.
