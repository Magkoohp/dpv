E0001,Implications of using SKOS vs OWL,"<p>This example highlights the implications of using DPV with RDFS+SKOS and OWL semantics. The RDFS+SKOS model is suitable for when DPV concepts have to be used 'directly' e.g. an use-case wants to use 'Encryption' from DPV as a technical measure without creating a specific 'instance' representing their implementation of the encryption. RDFS+SKOS model is also suitable for when an use-case wants to further create an hierarchical taxonomy of the different 'Encryption' concepts they are using. Such use of DPV concepts covers both T-box and A-box, and does not restrict or require the underlying ontology/schema to be constantly changed as new concepts are identified in an use-case.</p>
      <p>In comparison, the OWL2 model defines concepts as classes and instances with a clear separation between the two i.e. the Tbox and Abox are separate. This means the concept 'Encryption' cannot be directly used with OWL2 semantics and an instance of it must first be created. If instead DPV had provided 'Encryption' as an instance (of Technical Measure) then the further expansion and creation of a hierarchy of encryption concepts described earlier is not feasible in OWL2 as it results in a complex graph which is not efficient for reasoning. Further, making changes such as promoting 'Encryption' from instance to class requires changing the ontology/schema - which may not always be possible or feasible in use-cases.</p>
      <p>Thus, the relative strengths and weaknesses of RDFS+SKOS and OWL2 serialisations dictate which should be used. RDFS+SKOS is 'lightweight' and better if the use-case only requires rudimentary or simple reasoning. OWL2 is  better suited for semantic reasoners that can perform complex discovery and validation processes but require more strict and restricted use of concepts. By providing both serialisations, DPV enables the adopters to choose the most suitable serialisation that supports their use-case and/or existing implementations, and retains semantic interoperability based on converting between SKOS and OWL2 (see <a href=""https://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/SKOS/skos-and-owl/master.html"">Using OWL and SKOS (2008)</a>).</p>",E0001.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0002,Extending concepts to represent use-case specific information,"<p>DPV defines the (broad) concept of <a href=""https://w3id.org/dpv#Marketing""><code>Marketing</code></a> in its <code>Purpose</code> hierarchy to represent information about (purposes related to) marketing activities and topics. For a use-case which requires representing purposes (note: plural) related to <i>marketing of new products</i>, the broad <code>Marketing</code> concept is extended as a <i>child</i> or <i>subclass</i> concept for representing the intended purpose as, e.g. <code>MarketingNewProducts</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Here the prefix <code>ex:</code> represents <code>http://example.com#</code> - which is a convention for representing additional examples or concepts, such as those created as part of the use-case. The rest of the document follows this nomenclature and convention.</p>",E0002.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0003,Extending multiple concepts,"<p>For example, two TV companies (<code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code>) extend the concept <code>Optimisation</code> to reflect their respective purposes. When exchanging information about their use-cases with each other (or with a third party), by following the chain of use-case specific concepts it is possible to deduce that both <code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code> are doing optimisations for consumers. Thus a common language or interface can be developed based on using DPV as a point of interoperability and commonality which can be used by adopters to define the specifics of their use-case. For example, in the above use-case, a common notice generation algorithm could be created and used to inform users of both services the purposes each company is using data for.</p>",E0003.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Purpose,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0006,Nesting Processes,"<p>Consider the example where <em>Acme</em>, as a <em>DataController</em>, maintains records of its processing activities using <code>Process</code> to represent one of its services. In this, it collects email, uses it for internal analyses based on <em>Legitimate Interests</em>, and also sends marketing information by using a processor based on the data subject's consent. Using nesting of processes, the information can be expressed at a granular level representing service, individual purposes, and so on.</p>",E0006.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Process,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0007,Extending Purposes and adding human-readable descriptions,"<p>In this example, a new purpose is created by extending <code>dpv:FraudPreventionAndDetection</code> and annotated with human-readable information. The interpretation of this purpose is thus more clear in relation to how it is applied or used within that use-case, and also serves to compare it with other purposes within the same category.</p>",E0007.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:Purpose,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0009,Derivation and inference of personal data,"<p>This use-case collects browser fingerprint and IP Address to identify the country one is visiting from, and to infer language to be used for personalisation.

E0010,Indicating personal data is sensitive or special category,"<p>In a medical study involving genetic data, the person's collected blood samples are considered to be 'special category' personal data under the GDPR. In addition to this, the person's identifier associated with that dataset to enable monitoring future appointments is considered sensitive within the medical centre. Note that the examples use the [[PD]] extension to represent some concepts.</p>
        <p>In this example, the knowledge that blood samples are of type 'special category' can be inferred from the fact that they are a form of <i>Medical Health</i> which is a 'special category'. However, the example considers best practices that suggest explicitly identifying and denoting that blood samples are also of type 'special category'.</p>",E0010.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:SensitivePersonalData,dpv:SpecialCategoryPersonalData",,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0011,Indicating Storage Conditions,"<p>This example includes Acme as a Data Processor that stores data within servers located in Ireland for a period of one year. The temporal information is represented using [[[TIME]]], and the location is specified using [[[LOC]]].</p><p>In this example, the <code>StorageCondition</code> is expressed as a separate policy applicable. It is also possible to directly express it over other concepts such as a service, technology, or a processing operation, e.g. to say <code>ex:AcmeStore dpv:hasStorageCondition ...</code>.</p>",E0011.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:StorageCondition,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J. Pandit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E0012,Indicating Data Sources,"<p>Data sources can be the data subject (direct or indirect), the data controller or processor (itself), or another entity (third party). The below example provides an overview of these with distinctions between source and method of generation.</p>
        <p>In this example, <code>ex:S01</code> represents direct collection of data from the data subject, while <code>ex:S02</code> represents indirect collection where data is derived or observed - or undergoes any operation that still points to the data subject as the source. <code>ex:S03</code> infers data, which means the inferring entity (the Controller in this case) is the source of this data - even if the inferred data is based on data collected from the Data Subject. <code>ex:S04</code> has data sourced from another entity - such as a Third Party, but could also refer to a Data Processor. <code>ex:S05</code> represents collection of data from a public dataset that has been published by the data subject themselves.</p>
        <p>Note that the above example is illustrative - it may be pertinent to provide documentation about each data source to ensure sufficient information is recorded for intended purposes. For example, the method of collection (e.g. forms), or inference (e.g. algorithm), or public dataset (e.g. link, license).</p>",E0012.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:DataSource,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0013,Spam filter as Automated Decision Making with Human Involvement,"<p>Consider the use of a spam filter that is based on automated processing operations where humans provide inputs, have oversight of the operation, and results in automated decision making for whether communications should be propagated. A new separate filter is developed that utilises a novel spam detection criteria that also takes into account communications other than emails for the sender and makes automated decisions whether to permit communication to proceed. Such explicit annotation of several high-risk operations assists in performing impact assessments for this technology, as well as understanding the extent and effectiveness of human involvement to mitigate risks and issues.</p>
        <p>In this example, the Spam Filter process allows the users to reverse the effects (i.e. emails marked as spam) but does not allow opting out from the process (i.e. stop spam filtering). The spam detection algorithm performs automated decision making (by deciding which emails to accept), systemic monitoring (of communications), and evaluation and scoring (by scoring contents of emails and senders/recipients). The spam detection algorithm also indicates what human involvement is expected - to provide input (e.g. mark emails as spam) and intervention (e.g. change spam criterias).</p>",E0013.ttl,ttl,file,"dpv:AutomationLevel,dpv:HumanInvolvement",,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0014,Denoting Legal Basis within a Process,"<p>The <code>LegalBasis</code> can be associated with any concept using the relation <code>hasLegalBasis</code>. Such associations are of three types: (1) where the legal basis refers to an instance, such as the consent or contract associated with a particular data subject; (2)  where the legal basis refers to the category that will be used to justify processing, such as the concept <i>consent</i> to denote consent will be the basis for indicated processing; and lastly (3) where the legal basis is defined with a context, such as <i>consent of service consumers</i>.</p>",E0014.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:LegalBasis,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.

E0016,Indicating details about an individual's consent,"<p>In this example, an individual's consent is recorded with abstraction in the form of linking to a common process instance from the previous example. This 'common' process represents processing taking place for all data subjects, whereas the consent instance refers only to the individual with a link to this common information. This is to present an alternative method for storing information as compared to extensive consent records.</p>",E0016.ttl,ttl,file,dpv:ConsentRecord,,accepted,2024-06-10,Harshvardhan J.
