        <h2>[v0.8.2] - <time datetime="2022-10-06">06 Oct 2022</time></h2>
        <p>This is a minor release providing fixes to the <a href="#dpv-v0.8.1">release candidate</a>. It makes the following changes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change concepts to use <code>subtype</code> instead of <code>instance</code> for the following: Context (<code>Duration</code>, <code>Frequency</code>), Entity (<code>Organisation</code>, <code>DataSubject</code>), Location.</li>
            <li>This change also fixes issues where some OWL concepts were being declared as instances instead of subclasses.</li>
            <li>Change <i>Anonymisation</i> terms for accuracy and unambiguity, where there is now no direct relation between anonymisation and pseudonymisation. The labels and parents have been updated to reflect this, and all terms have the common parent <code>DataAnonymisationTechnique</code>. <code>CompleteAnonymisation</code> has been deprecated as the concept is covered by <code>Anonymisation</code>. <code>PseudoAnonymisation</code> has been renamed to <code>Pseudonymisation</code>. The term <code>DataRedaction</code> has been added as a type of <code>DataSanitisationTechnique</code>.</li>
            <li>Change term <code>AutomatedProcessingWithHumanVerification</code> to <code>AutomatedProcessingWithHumanReview</code> to reflect the broader use of <i>review</i> as compared to <i>verify</i>.</li>
            <li>Split <code>EvaluationScoring</code> into distinct concepts representing Evaluation and Scoring (of individuals).</li>
            <li>Fix label of Purpose <code>ServiceUsageAnalytics</code> - raised in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/54">#54 by @aucampia</a>.</li>
            <li>Provides better description for cases where a property does not have domain or range specified - raised in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/52">#52 by @bertvannuffelen</a>.</li>
            <li>Adds definition of <code>Concept</code> - raised in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/51">#51 by bertvannuffelen</a>.</li>
            <li>Change term <code>AnonymisedDataWithinContext</code> to better reflect its intended use as <code>ContextuallyAnonymisedData</code>.</li>

    <h2>[v0.8] - <time datetime="2022-08-26">26 Aug 2022</time></h2>
    <p>v0.8 makes several major changes to the DPV in preparation for progressing the work towards v1. It adds Consent states and types, and marks existing properties for deprecation in favour of new uniform properties that harmonise how notice and legal bases work in conjunction. The various statuses have now been organised in a dedicated module - <i>Status</i>. The technical and organisational measures are separated into dedicated modules, and contain substantial additions to each (148 total additions). The concepts related to various scales have been moved to the module <i>ProcessingScale</i>. This iteration adds the <b>risk</b> and <b>rights</b> extensions. It also expands the core risk vocabulary to express levels, severity, and likelihood.</p>
    <p>v0.8 also changes how DPV serialisation files and documentation are generated. It significantly updates the templating system used internally, fixes several bugs and errors, and allows expressing arbitrary values for concepts - useful to express <i>rdf:value</i> and <i>level, severity, likelihood</i> associated with risk concepts. It also fixes issue #44 dpv-tech properties incorrect domain/range; and #37 #41 Adds property domains/ranges in HTML.</p>
    <p>v0.8 introduces the generation of release <i>zips</i> that are intended to be uploaded to GitHub or other release platforms. These files are ignored by git.</p>

        <h2>[v0.5] - <time datetime="2022-04-02">02 April 2022</time></h2>
        <p>v0.5 makes changes to the structuring of DPV, with two new modules for expressing Entities and Risk related concepts. It also adds the DPV-LEGAL extension providing a taxonomy of jurisdictions, laws, and authorities.</p>
        <p><i>Risk:</i>The existing concepts from Technical and Organisational Measures related to risk were consolidated under the <i>Risk</i> module alongside additional concepts associated with consequences and impacts.</p>
        <p><i>Entities:</i> The earlier entities module has been restructured to differentiate between different categorisations of entities, such as legal roles, basic concepts, types of organisations, authorities, etc.</p>
        <p>Fixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixes <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/34">#34</a> regarding incorrect link</li>
            <li>Fix missing link to non-module concepts i.e. rights and risk not being defined in HTML</li>
            <li>Ensure consistency in links and text for DPV family of documents</li>
            <li>Add links to all documents (specs, extensions, guides)</li>
            <li>Fix incorrect IRIs in DPV-SKOS</li>

        <p>v0.4 makes important and <strong>backwards incompatible</strong> changes in terms of how it expresses the concepts and relationships. It also moves the namespace to <a href="https://w3id.org/">w3id.org</a> for all its documents. Most importantly, DPV is now presented as an abstract 'data model' that is recorded using SKOS. Specific serialisations are provided for use as an ontology in two variants: first using SKOS+RDFS and the second using OWL2. In addition to these, the personal data concepts have been moved to a separate extension, i.e. DPV-PD, to prevent overlap and conflict with other concepts still in DPV. A <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/v1.0/primer">Primer</a> has been added to provide an overview of the DPV, its semantics, and concepts, and also to explain the above changes in structure.</p>

        <h2>[v0.2] - <time datetime="2021-01-06">14 Jan 2021</time></h2>
        <h3>Release Notes</h3>
        <p>v0.2 represents an update to v0.1 in terms of added new concepts in the hierarchy, expanded base vocabulary, and some backwards-incompatible changes.</p>
        <p>The <b>core/base vocabulary</b> has new concepts for <em>Risk</em>, <em>Right</em>, and <em><i>DataSubjectRight</i></em>. These are associated with <em><i>PersonalDataHandling</i></em> using the relations <em>hasRisk</em> and <em>hasRight</em> respectively.</p>
        <p><b>Personal Data Categories</b> has new concepts for <em><i>BrowsingReferral</i></em>, <em><i>PaymentCard</i></em>, <em><i>PaymentCardNumber</i></em>, <em><i>PaymentCardExpiry</i></em>, <em><i>DeviceSoftware</i></em>, <em><i>DeviceOperatingSystem</i></em>, <em><i>DeviceApplications</i></em>, <em><i>AuthenticationHistory</i></em></p>
        <p><b>Purposes</b> has new concepts for <em>Marketing</em>, <em><i>DirectMarketing</i></em>, <em>Advertising</em>, <em><i>PersonalisedAdvertising</i></em>, <em><i>UsageAnalytics</i></em>, <em><i>CommunicationForCustomerCare</i></em>, <em><i>LegalCompliance</i></em>, <em>Payment</em>, <em><i>SocialMediaMarketing</i></em>, <em><i>RegistrationAuthentication</i></em></p>
        <p><b>Processing</b> attributes, such as those for indicating systematic monitoring, large scale, etc. have been removed as boolean properties and added as classes. Full list: <em><i>SystematicMonitoring</i></em>, <em><i>EvaluationScoring</i></em>, <em><i>MatchingCombining</i></em>, <em><i>AutomatedDecisionMaking</i></em>, <em><i>LargeScaleProcessing</i></em>, <em><i>InnovativeUseOfNewTechnologies</i></em>. This is so as to enable assocaiting additional information and semantics for concepts, such as specific types, categories, relations, and enable broader use in context of processing. For example, indicating the specific algorithm or process for automated decision making - which could not be indicated using a boolean value. In addition to these, the concept for <em><i>DataSource</i></em> has been added. Generic properties added are: <em>has<i>DataSource</i></em>, <em>has<i>AlgorithmicLogic</i></em>, <em>hasConsequences</em>, <em>has<i>HumanInvolvement</i></em>.</p>
        <p><b>Technical and Organisational Measures</b> have new concepts for: <em><i>SingleSignOn</i></em>, <em><i>ImpactAssessment</i></em>, <em>PIA</em>, <em>DPIA</em>, <em>Consultation</em>, <em><i>ConsultationWithAuthority</i></em>. The concept <em><i>RiskMitigationMeasure</i></em> and its associated property <em>mitigatesRisk</em> has been added to indicate risk and mitigation. The existing properties for storage, location, duration, and measure implementation have been modified to avoid name duplication. For example, <em>storage</em> as a property and <em>Storage</em> as a concept are equivalent when used as HTML identifiers. To avoid this, the names have been prefixed, which also adds consistency to the vocabulary naming. The properties are: <em>measure<i>ImplementedBy</i></em>, <em>hasStorage</em>, <em>hasLocation</em>, <em>hasDuration</em>.</p>
        <p><b>Entities</b> added as new concepts include <em><i>LegalEntity</i></em>, <em><i>DataSubProcessor</i></em>, <em>Child</em>, <em><i>DataProtectionOfficer</i></em>, <em>Representative</em>, <em>Authority</em>, <em><i>DataProtectionAuthority</i></em>, <em><i>VulnerableDataSubject</i></em>. Generic properties for expressing information about entities added are: <em>hasName</em>, <em>hasAddress</em>, <em>hasContact</em>, <em>hasIdentifier</em>, <em>hasRepresentative</em>.</p>
