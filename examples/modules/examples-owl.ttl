When exchanging information about their use-cases with each other (or with a third party), by following the chain of use-case specific concepts it is possible to deduce that both <code>AliceCo</code> and <code>BobCo</code> are doing optimisations for consumers. Thus a common language or interface can be developed based on using DPV as a point of interoperability and commonality which can be used by adopters to define the specifics of their use-case. For example, in the above use-case, a common notice generation algorithm could be created and used to inform users of both services the purposes each company is using data for." ;
