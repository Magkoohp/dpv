    dct:description """<p>This example highlights the implications of using DPV with RDFS+SKOS and OWL semantics. The RDFS+SKOS model is suitable for when DPV concepts have to be used 'directly' e.g. an use-case wants to use 'Encryption' from DPV as a technical measure without creating a specific 'instance' representing their implementation of the encryption. RDFS+SKOS model is also suitable for when an use-case wants to further create an hierarchical taxonomy of the different 'Encryption' concepts they are using. Such use of DPV concepts covers both T-box and A-box, and does not restrict or require the underlying ontology/schema to be constantly changed as new concepts are identified in an use-case.</p>
      <p>In comparison, the OWL2 model defines concepts as classes and instances with a clear separation between the two i.e. the Tbox and Abox are separate. This means the concept 'Encryption' cannot be directly used with OWL2 semantics and an instance of it must first be created. If instead DPV had provided 'Encryption' as an instance (of Technical Measure) then the further expansion and creation of a hierarchy of encryption concepts described earlier is not feasible in OWL2 as it results in a complex graph which is not efficient for reasoning. Further, making changes such as promoting 'Encryption' from instance to class requires changing the ontology/schema - which may not always be possible or feasible in use-cases.</p>
      <p>Thus, the relative strengths and weaknesses of RDFS+SKOS and OWL2 serialisations dictate which should be used. RDFS+SKOS is 'lightweight' and better if the use-case only requires rudimentary or simple reasoning. OWL2 is  better suited for semantic reasoners that can perform complex discovery and validation processes but require more strict and restricted use of concepts. By providing both serialisations, DPV enables the adopters to choose the most suitable serialisation that supports their use-case and/or existing implementations, and retains semantic interoperability based on converting between SKOS and OWL2 (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/SKOS/skos-and-owl/master.html">Using OWL and SKOS (2008)</a>).</p>""" ;
