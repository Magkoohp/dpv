<h3 id=t01>Presentation by Piero Bonatti on using DPVCG's outcomes in TRAPEZE</h3>
<p id=x009 class=summary><a href="https://trapeze-project.eu/">https://<wbr>trapeze-project.eu/</a> TRAPEZE is a H2020 project, a sprititual successor to SPECIAL project which was the progenitor of DPVCG</p>
<p id=x010 class=summary>In TRAPEZE, automating compliance checking (specifically about consent) is the focus and the architecture and use of DPV is focused on these</p>
<p id=x011 class=summary>Stakeholders have dashboards for viewing and interacting with their respective roles and data</p>
<p id=x012 class=summary>Use cases related to compliance: policy compliance with GDPR, with consent, and re-use of consent</p>
<p id=x013 class=summary>User agents help with checking compatibility of preferences in policies and understanding consequences of consent (what-if queries)</p>
<p id=x014 class=summary>Missing in DPV is Disjoint Classes e.g. purpose with processing, recipient</p>
<p id=x019 class="phone s01"><cite>Piero:</cite> some terms can be describe in more / with more details (to follow up later)<br>
<span id=x020>… Example of CommercialInterest for granularity i.e. subclasses of CommercialInterest fulfil any consent given to CommercialInterest (to follow up later)</span><br>
<span id=x021>… (will ask to share slides for reference)</span><br>
<span id=x022>… Q&amp;A Session</span></p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> CommercialInterest was used in the examples, but in DPV we have decided to deprecate the term as it is too vague and difficult to apply in practice. How is its use involved in TRAPEZE?</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s01"><cite>Piero:</cite> This was just an ad-hoc example. If term is vague and not suitable, DPV should deprecate it.</p>
<p id=x031 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> (discussing on Architecture and feature set and use of DPV)<br>
<span id=x032>… Collection of questions follows below.</span><br>
<span id=x033>… The specification used by TRAPEZE borrows @context from JSON-LD, but is not the same or compatible with JSON-LD. This is because in JSON-LD the values of properties are taken to be instances (some info may have been lost in notes here).</span><br>
<span id=x034>… In addition, lists are different in JSON-LD where they could imply intersection whereas in TRAPEZE the requirement is to have union of concepts e.g. purposes.</span><br>
<span id=x035>… Discussion on whether DPV should model deontic concepts (e.g. permission, prohibition) to restrict or specify constraints on data. Opinion is that this is difficult to do while ensuring the generality of DPV as a vocabulary.</span><br>
<span id=x036>… Experiments can take place under a separate extension to figure out how this might work, but for now DPV can remain agnostic for such terms.</span><br>
<span id=x037>… Suggestion taken from Piero's presentation to consider inclusion of concepts such as Anonymised Data and its use e.g. Blurred Location Data.</span></p>
