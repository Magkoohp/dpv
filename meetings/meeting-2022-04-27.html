<h3 id=t01>Proposed concepts for Technology</h3>
<p id=x010 class=summary>We have several concepts collected and proposed under the Technology extension (namespace dpv-tech). We are now discussing them for sufficiency, design, structuring, etc.</p>
<p id=x011 class=summary>Discussion consensus that the current list of terms is inadequate, and needs several other concepts that need to be represented. Propoals for these are welcome.</p>
<p id=x012 class=summary>Some potential sources for finding such terms are: ENISA reports, ISO standards, even Wikipedia entries where there is a list or taxonomy to adopt.</p>
<p id=x013 class=summary>For example, ENISA has a document on Data Protection Engineering that talks about concepts such as data security and encryption <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/data-protection-engineering">https://<wbr>www.enisa.europa.eu/<wbr>publications/<wbr>data-protection-engineering</a></p>
<p id=x014 class=summary>Georg has proposed concepts related to plugins (e.g. wordpress plugins), scripts, stylesheets, fonts, etc.</p>
<p id=x015 class=summary>Paul has proposed concepts regarding Encryption at rest, Encryption in transit, Vulnerability scanning, SIEM, Firewalls, Patching, MFA / 2FA</p>
<p id=x016 class=summary>Mark has suggested inclusion of concepts associated with tracking and fingerprinting from <a href="https://privacytests.org/private.html">https://<wbr>privacytests.org/<wbr>private.html</a></p>
<p id=x017 class=summary>In these discussions, the overlap and conflict between Technology and TOMs (Technical/Organisational Measures) is apparent as often times the concept seems to be duplicated.</p>
<p id=x018 class=summary>Our aim is to avoid duplication where possible. TOMs are 'abstract concepts' that specify a generic principle or concept, whereas the Technology concepts provide specific implementation details for how those are realised.</p>
<p id=x019 class=summary>An example is Encryption, which is a TOM, and then specific kinds of encryption which are technologies.</p>
<p id=x020 class=summary>This needs more introspection and discussion to have a clear criteria or explanation for separation or relation between the two.</p>
<p id=x021 class=summary>It would be beneficial, for example, to have a real-life product as an instance of Technology, and have an annotated list of TOMs is implements or provides. And vice-versa.</p>
<p id=x022 class=summary>In discussion of concepts, the notion of what is a 'Technology' came up, particularly in relation to the concept 'Service' with the argument that it may or may not be a service.</p>
<p id=x023 class=summary>For now, we exclude Service concept and focus on adding other concepts. The Digital Services Act may provide some reusable definitions for what is a service, or whether to define technology as being restricted to Digital Service.</p>
