<section>
<h3 id=t01>DPV v0.4 and Primer</h3>
<p id=x011 class=summary>DPV v0.4 and Primer are ready to be published.</p>
<p id=x012 class=summary>DPV-SKOS and DPV-OWL need some minor adjustments to produce serialisations.</p>
<p id=x013 class=summary>These will be published later in the day.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Use-Cases and Examples</h3>
<p id=x015 class=summary>Moving forward, the emphasis is on collecting and documenting use-cases that are to be used as requirements for DPV.</p>
<p id=x016 class=summary>This can mean ensuring the required concepts are present, or identifying areas which need further discussion / enrichment.</p>
<p id=x017 class=summary>Use-cases are also useful to demonstrate where the DPV can be applied, and can act as descriptions for creating examples.</p>
<p id=x018 class=summary>We will have both simple (something has personal data) and complex (modelling data transfers with its own specific legal basis based on GDPR requirements ...) use-cases and examples.</p>
<p id=x019 class="phone s01"><cite>jan:</cite> The modelling of COVID-19 passed, where consent is collected, or data is collected and retained, could be a relevant use-case.</p>
<p id=x020 class="phone s01"><cite>jan:</cite> The depiction of how DPV concepts act together towards assisting/fulfilling GDPR compliance requirements would be another relevant area for use-cases.</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> A relevant resource regarding DPV is the Standard Data Protection Model (SDM) - a specification developed by German DPAs <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/EN/Fachthemen/Inhalte/Technik/SDM.html">https://<wbr>www.bfdi.bund.de/<wbr>EN/<wbr>Fachthemen/<wbr>Inhalte/<wbr>Technik/<wbr>SDM.html</a></p>
<p id=x022 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> Alignment of DPV with such specification / standards can help in demonstrating its practicality as well as ensuring the vocabulary is 'complete' and 'useful' through the concepts and examples.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Frequency</h3>
<p id=x027 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> There is a proposal on modelling <code>Frequency</code> as a concept in terms of period repetitions for representing how often something happens.<br>
<span id=x028>… For example, data collection duration could be 1 year, and the frequency of daily would indicate it happens once per day over the year.</span><br>
<span id=x029>… <code>Frequency</code> could be expressed (using <code>hasFrequency</code>) over concepts such as Processing, PersonalDataHandling, etc.</span><br>
<span id=x030>… Concept is accepted after discussion.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Optionality of Concepts</h3>
<p id=x032 class="phone s03"><cite>georg:</cite> How to indicate, for example, personal data is optional to a purpose?</p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> One way to (directly) express this is to say <code>Purpose hasPersonalData PersonalData</code> and to indicate that as <code>hasContext Optional</code> at either Purpose or PersonalData scope.</p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> A better way to do this would be to instead create 'units' e.g. using <code>PersonalDataHandling</code>, and to denote them as being required or optional. So for this use, two <code>PersonalDataHandling</code> where one represents the required parts and the other optional ones.</p>
<p id=x035 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> The Primer has a rudimentary example for this in the <code>Context</code> section.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Consequence of not providing data</h3>
<p id=x037 class="phone s03"><cite>georg:</cite> How to represent the consequences of personal data not being provided for a purpose? (as required within GDPR)</p>
<p id=x038 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> It is very difficult to model what happens when something is <u>not</u> done. One logical consequence is that if personal data is <u>required</u> for a purpose, then not providing it results in that purpose not being fulfilled.</p>
<p id=x041 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> The second aspect to representing such consequences is then understanding what happens, other than the purpose, in case personal data is not provided<br>
<span id=x042>… Proposal for two subtypes of <code>Consequence</code> as <code>ConsequenceOfSuccess</code> and <code>ConsequenceOfFailure</code> to indicate the resulting consequences when something 'succeeds' or 'takes place', and when it 'fails' or 'does not take place'.</span><br>
<span id=x043>… Discussion welcome until next week.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t06>Expressing Order</h3>
<p id=x048 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> To express order to denote something happens, takes place, or is placed before or after something. E.g. collection of data is prior to use - where this order is arbitrary and loosely defined, as collection can continue while usage also takes place.<br>
<span id=x049>… Proposal is to have two concepts: <code>followsFrom</code> and <code>isFollowedBy</code> to denote the order of concepts.</span><br>
<span id=x050>… Discussion on the correctness of terms, with alternate proposals: <code>followsOn</code> instead of <code>followsFrom</code>.</span><br>
<span id=x051>… Rudimentary consensus on relations <code>isBefore</code> and <code>isAfter</code> as abstract denotion of order. To be discussed until next week.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t07>Scope of DPV</h3>
<p id=x053 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> Where possible, large overlaps with other existing vocabularies that are either: standardised, well-defined, or widely-used - is to be avoided so DPV instead can focus on specific terms not available elsewhere.</p>
<p id=x054 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> For cases where similar concepts (to those existing externally) are needed, we may define rudimentary and simplistics ones in the vocabulary for convenience and completeness.</p>
<p id=x058 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> For more complex uses and requirements, it is recommended to instead utilise the other vocabularies in conjunction / combination with DPV.<br>
<span id=x059>… Discussion relevant to the recording of 'data flows', start times, etc. - which are possible through PROV.</span><br>
<span id=x060>… Similar overlaps exist with ODRL in terms of permissions, prohibitions, parties. etc.</span><br>
<span id=x061>… The recommendation is to utilise these (or others) where the requirements for using DPV have a significant overlap or alignment with their provisions. For example, to model the order in which data is collected and its timestamps, PROV can provide the necessary concepts to represent processing as workflows.</span></p>
<p id=x062 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> GDPRov <a href="http://w3id.org/GDPRov">http://<wbr>w3id.org/<wbr>GDPRov</a> is one such implementation showing combination of PROV and GDPR-concepts, which can be replicated/extended to work with DPV</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t08>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x064 class="phone s02"><cite>harsh:</cite> We will continue discussion on pending concepts next week at FEB-23 13:00 WET / 14:00 CET.</p>
