<section>
<h3 id=t01>Clarity of Purposes</h3>
<p id=x010 class=summary>relevant emails - <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Oct/0008.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Oct/<wbr>0008.html</a> and <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Oct/0009.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Oct/<wbr>0009.html</a></p>
<p id=x011 class=summary>Piero (from TRAPEZE) raised an issue regarding how Purposes are selected. The specific example relates to a banking use-case where purposes are i) maintain bank accounts, ii) execute payments, and iii) manage portfolios</p>
<p id=x012 class=summary>For these, two purposes seem to be applicable - a) RequestedServiceProvision; and b) SellProductsToDataSubject</p>
<p id=x013 class=summary>The issue is to offer clarity in how purposes are applicable or should be selected, and to see if there are overlaps between concepts which should be rectified.</p>
<p id=x014 class=summary>The group discussed the general practices regarding purposes, where most real-life examples are vague and abstract intentionally, and therefore are a common source of ambiguity.</p>
<p id=x015 class=summary>DPV can help with this by providing specific strong concepts that reduce ambiguity and assist in expressing use-cases in as much detail as possible.</p>
<p id=x016 class=summary>For this, we discussed the use-case, and concluded with the following interpretation. The purpose should be <code>SellProductsToDataSubject</code> in case where the products are being marketed or provided to the data subject, but they have not been purchased or availed of yet. This means the products are not a service currently being provided (i.e. there is distinction between current and future). <code>SellProductsToDataSubject</code> is therefore applicable here.</p>
<p id=x017 class=summary>In the case where a contract has been established, and this means a service is being provided by the bank to the customer, even if this involves charging money, the purpose is <code>RequestedServiceProvision</code> because of the agreement that states such service provision and data required.</p>
<p id=x018 class=summary>The legal basis for Selling Products could be A.6-1f Legitimate Interest whereas for Requested Service Provision it would be A.6-1b Contract.</p>
<p id=x019 class=summary>The group discussed the need to clarify such uses within the descriptions of purposes and offer as much clarity and example as is possible. For this, a sub-group will refine the purposes (harsh, georg, paul).</p>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Exercising Rights</h3>
<p id=x021 class=summary>(continued from previous meeting)</p>
<p id=x022 class=summary>reelvant email - <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Oct/0004.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Oct/<wbr>0004.html</a></p>
<p id=x023 class=summary>The group discussed the proposal to keep records of right exercises. The example only lists the part relevant to recording exercising activities.</p>
<p id=x024 class=summary>The information for how to exercise a right, what data is needed, etc. is provided as part of the Right Exercise Point/Service concept.</p>
<p id=x025 class=summary>The group discussed the examples, its practicality, and identifed aspects that are missing.</p>
<p id=x026 class=summary>For cases where an action is delayed, we add the status <code>ActionDelayed</code>. For example, a Controller needs more time to fulfill the right exercised.</p>
<p id=x027 class=summary>To specify duration associated with rights, we have the existing concepts. For example, information about right exercise means the duration is how long the activity will take.</p>
<p id=x028 class=summary>Duration associated with action delayed means how much additional time it will take.</p>
<p id=x029 class=summary>We will have to write these interpretations clearly in the spec.</p>
<p id=x030 class=summary>We will also be collecting Justifications for different statuses, including those for NonFulfilment as well as Delays and other things associated with Right Exercises.</p>
<p id=x031 class=summary>Our scope if limited to Right for now, and not other requests in general.</p>
<p id=x032 class=summary>The framework being developed here is for generic rights, and is not specific to GDPR.</p>
<p id=x033 class=summary>We will be establishing the base framework, and then creating specific extensions for GDPR's rights.</p>
<p id=x034 class=summary>Georg and Paul will be creating a list of Justifications for rights related actions not being completed (in time or at all).</p>
<p id=x035 class=summary>Harsh and Beatriz will be looking at creating specific GDPR rights concepts from the base concepts.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x037 class=summary>We will be meeting again in 1 week, on NOV-02 13:00 WET / 14:00 CET.</p>
<p id=x039 class=summary>Another item of note is the SEMIC conference regarding EU vocabularies that are relevant / tangential to DPV - <a href="https://internationaldataspaces.org/events/semic-conference-2022/">https://<wbr>internationaldataspaces.org/<wbr>events/<wbr>semic-conference-2022/</a></p>
<p id=x040 class=summary>For us, vocabularies we have to align with include SEMIC vocabs <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/31">w3c/<wbr>dpv#31</a> so its worthwhile to keep this link.</p>
