<section>
<h3 id=t01>Decision on Personal Data Categories naming and extension</h3>
<p id=x012 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Consensus seems to be on moving personal data categories to an extension as it allows using categories as they are, but also keeping them separate i.e. cleaner and modular design</p>
<p id=x013 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Another related issue is that the name <code>PersonalDataCategory</code> is not appropriate to indicate an instance of personal data, e.g. me@example.com</p>
<p id=x020 class="phone s02"><cite>inah:</cite> is the concept of a 'category' exhaustive enough to indicate what personal data is involved<br>
<span id=x021>… Current proposal is to move personal data categories to a separate extension (dpv-pd) and keep the core concepts within the main DPV</span><br>
<span id=x022>… Proposal accepted, no objections or reservations</span><br>
<span id=x023>… Some concerns about backwards compatibility and what the changes will imply for users/adopters</span><br>
<span id=x024>… However, this change permits evolving personal data vocabulary separately from rest of DPV, and also prevents confusion about concepts (e.g. Location) common to both</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Renaming PersonalDataCategory to PersonalData</h3>
<p id=x036 class="phone s02"><cite>inah:</cite> Github <a href="https://github.com/w3c/issue/issues/27">issue#27</a><a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/27">w3c/<wbr>dpv#27</a><br>
<span id=x037>… Reason is that PersonalDataCategory (PDC) is indicative of categories, not instances of personal data</span><br>
<span id=x038>… So, for indicating a particular personal data instance, such as me@example.com is involved, is not possible</span><br>
<span id=x039>… doing hasPDC 'me@example.com' is incorrect as it declares it as an 'instance of category'</span><br>
<span id=x040>… Hence, proposal is to rename PDC to just PersonalData (PD)</span><br>
<span id=x041>… With PD, instances can be represented correctly as hasPD X where X is an instance of PD</span><br>
<span id=x042>… With PD, categories or groups or sets can also be represented using the semantics of classes, such as hasPD X where X is a subclass of PD</span><br>
<span id=x043>… Proposal accepted without objections or reservations other than backwards compatibility and indicating change to users/adopters</span><br>
<span id=x044>… A note on real-world usage of PD - both instances and classes/categories are used interchangeably as required within use-cases. For e.g., &quot;your email me@example.com is collected...&quot; for instance, and &quot;your location is collected...&quot; for category</span><br>
<span id=x045>… Group agrees on need to provide examples and guidance on usage of PD in such manner to indicate both instances and categories, such as through the primer or additional documentation</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Dicussion on Christmas break and reconvening in new year</h3>
<p id=x048 class="phone s02"><cite>inah:</cite> We will be meeting again on JAN-05 at 13:00 WET / 14:00 CET<br>
<span id=x049>… Topics for discussion will be continuation of agenda, i.e. data subject categories and (later discussed) jurisdiction</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Multi-language support within DPV</h3>
<p id=x051 class="phone s03"><cite>jan:</cite> is there any work on expressing concepts using multiple languages (e.g. EN, FR, DE)</p>
<p id=x052 class="phone s03"><cite>jan:</cite> Paul Knowles has expressed interest in taking up this work to provide translations</p>
<p id=x053 class="phone s04"><cite>georg:</cite> Signatu has a GDPR lexicon which provides concepts in multiple languages, see <a href="https://gdprlexicon.com/">https://<wbr>gdprlexicon.com/</a> ; However, this is prorprietary and needs to be discussed internally for contribution to DPV</p>
<p id=x055 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> IATE is EU's official language-based concept thesauri offering translations in several languages. See <a href="https://iate.europa.eu/">https://<wbr>iate.europa.eu/</a> ; such concepts span several laws and need a professional or fluent speaker who knows legalese to identify the correct term in their language<br>
<span id=x056>… Group notes that contributions to express DPV in languages other than EN are welcome</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Jurisdiction expression in DPV</h3>
<p id=x060 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> The proposal is to have the concept Jurisdiction and property hasJurisdiction to denote the applicable jurisdiction within information<br>
<span id=x061>… Jurisdiction can be further refined as Country, SupraNationalUnion (EU), EconomicUnion (EEA), and so on</span><br>
<span id=x062>… This allows expression of jurisdiction, e.g. to storage location or to entity</span></p>
<p id=x063 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> See example of countries, authorities, and adequacy decisions denoted using Jurisdiction concept here as Turtle/RDF - <a href="https://github.com/coolharsh55/dpv-x/blob/master/dpv-jurisdictions/juris.ttl">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>coolharsh55/<wbr>dpv-x/<wbr>blob/<wbr>master/<wbr>dpv-jurisdictions/<wbr>juris.ttl</a></p>
<p id=x064 class="phone s04"><cite>georg:</cite> When referring to jurisdiction, which interpretation is to be taken (e.g. legislative, enforcement)</p>
<p id=x065 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> No specific interpretation, except indicating which obligations apply or what/where can enforcement happen in terms of laws.</p>
<p id=x066 class="phone s03"><cite>jan:</cite> How to express trans-border agreements or flows based on agreements?</p>
<p id=x067 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Yes, this is possible by modeling adequacy decisions or agreements between two jurisdictions (see example file in notes), but the actual logic for checking sufficiency is based on implementation and use-case</p>
<p id=x068 class="phone s02"><cite>inah:</cite> Jurisdictions can be regional, cities, etc. ?</p>
<p id=x069 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Yes, though there is confusion between what further terms to use since there is no common agreement on what is a 'region' in terms of jurisdiction (i.e. governance or geographical). Needs further input.</p>
<p id=x070 class="phone s05"><cite>julian:</cite> for Germany, if in a region, then do three jurisdictions need to be defined, e.g. as region, DE, and EU? Or does specifying the region suffice since the others can be inferred from it?</p>
<p id=x071 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Based on use-case, if there is a need to indicate all jurisdictions, then that can be done by declaring all three. If only the applicable or relevant needs to be declared, then the region is declared, and the interpretation of applicable jurisdiction is done using the knowledge of membership between jurisdictions.</p>
<p id=x072 class="phone s02"><cite>inah:</cite> if Jurisdiction is left open (as in self-declarative), then what does this imply? Can someone declare the company as a jurisdiction?</p>
<p id=x073 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Possibly, though it would not be correct to use it as such because jurisdiction as a concept has meaning within law(s) and therefore should be used in accordance with that</p>
<p id=x074 class="phone s03"><cite>jan:</cite> For use of DPV, e.g. Jurisdiction, how does it ensure compatibility and interoperability between two different implementations if there no schema or template or profile?</p>
<p id=x075 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> It is difficult to get an agreement on a profile because of the vast differences in technologies, regions, and requirements. DPV foremost provides a vocabulary, where even if two different implementations use a different set of jurisdiction terms (e.g. regions of USA and EU respectively), then by declaring them as Jurisdiction using DPV it is clear and interoperable that they are jurisdictions, and use specific vocabularies.</p>
<p id=x076 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Further schemas or profiles can be created, but need agreement between use-cases and domains, which is difficult to achieve within the group at this point.</p>
