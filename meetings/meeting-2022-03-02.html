<h3 id=t01>DPV License (FYI)</h3>
<p id=x010 class=summary>Ongoing conversation on mailing list <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Mar/0002.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Mar/<wbr>0002.html</a></p>
<p id=x011 class=summary>Thread and DPV documentation/repo will be updated once there is some resolution on license</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Modelling Jurisdictions (proposal)</h3>
<p id=x013 class=summary>See <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Feb/0006.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Feb/<wbr>0006.html</a> for info</p>
<p id=x014 class=summary>This uses the location <em> DPA </em> laws concepts from DPV to model countries, DPAs, and relevant laws</p>
<p id=x015 class=summary>Currently all countries, EU membership (pre/post Brexit), EEA, EU DPAs, GDPR, and Adequacy decisions are provided</p>
<p id=x016 class=summary>Sources <a href="https://github.com/coolharsh55/dpv-x/blob/master/dpv-juris/sources.md">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>coolharsh55/<wbr>dpv-x/<wbr>blob/<wbr>master/<wbr>dpv-juris/<wbr>sources.md</a> include authoritative resources</p>
<p id=x017 class=summary>Volunteers can expand listing to include additional laws, DPAs, and adequacy decisions (or data transfer agreements) between countries outside EU</p>
<p id=x018 class=summary>So far we have received only requests/use-cases related to EU + data transfers, which this is sufficient for</p>
<p id=x019 class=summary>Proposal open for review until MAR-31. Comments will be reviewed and incorporated until then, after which this will be published as an extension to the DPV (e.g. dpv-juris)</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Use-case documentation</h3>
<p id=x021 class=summary>It is imperative and important to document the use-cases to both (i) assess DPV in terms of concepts is sufficient to model that use-case; and (ii) to demonstrate usefulness of DPV</p>
<p id=x022 class=summary>Use-case is a term used for a generic description of a situation which will be analysed to identify relevant concepts that the DPV should represent</p>
<p id=x023 class=summary>For descriptions of &quot;how to do X in DPV&quot;, consider writing documentation in the form of guides that target a specific domain or application. For e.g. creating ROPA with DPV.</p>
<p id=x024 class=summary>Use-cases should be simple to describe and record. For this reason, the minimal concepts identified to describe an use-case are: ID (assigned by DPVCG after acceptance), title, description, relevant concepts to model, and source (optional)</p>
<p id=x025 class=summary>Anything else can be provided for contextual information and discussion e.g. diagrams, additional descriptions.</p>
<p id=x026 class=summary>Use-cases will be stored on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/tree/master/use-cases">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>w3c/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>tree/<wbr>master/<wbr>use-cases</a> as RDF, and linked to concepts within the specification e.g. Data Transfer → See relevant use-cases (link to page listing use-cases where data transfers are mentioned as a relevant concept)</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Resolution of proposed concepts</h3>
<p id=x028 class=summary><strong>Consequence</strong></p>
<p id=x029 class=summary>The use-case is to denote what are the consequences of something not taking place e.g. (i) data not provided could result in service not being provided; (ii) rights not possible to exercise</p>
<p id=x030 class=summary>In this, (i) can be inferred from expressing data is necessary for a service. However, for indicating two, the proposal is to provide a way to indicate something is a consequence of 'failure'</p>
<p id=x031 class=summary>For example, one personal data handling instance specifies another instance as a consequence of failure</p>
<p id=x032 class=summary>No comments or preferences expressed. Harsh will check with proposal submitted (Georg) on the use-case and what concepts are necessary.</p>
<p id=x033 class=summary>Note → ODRL already models consequence and failure relations. Unless these are analysed and found to be non-compatible with the use-case, DPV should not repeat their semantics</p>
<p id=x034 class=summary>---</p>
<p id=x035 class=summary><strong>Technologies</strong></p>
<p id=x036 class=summary>We have a rudimentary list of technologies e.g. database, apps, OS, cookies</p>
<p id=x037 class=summary>Instead of DPV provisioning an ad-hoc incomplete list of technologies, these should be provided as a separate extension similar to dpv-pd that can grow at its own pace</p>
<p id=x038 class=summary>Agreement on providing technologies as a separate extension (dpv-tech)</p>
<p id=x039 class=summary>---</p>
<p id=x040 class=summary><strong>Data Breach</strong></p>
<p id=x041 class=summary>Instead of modelling data breach as a singular concept, DPV should look towards modelling all concepts relevant to data breaches e.g. records, what data was affected, actors involved, notification to authorities and data subjects</p>
<p id=x042 class=summary>These should be provisioned as a separate extension to avoid mixing DPV concepts (e.g. entities and actors) with data breach specific concepts</p>
<p id=x043 class=summary>We invite proposals for modelling data breaches via the public mailing list</p>
<p id=x044 class=summary>---</p>
<p id=x045 class=summary><strong>Benefits and Beneficiary</strong></p>
<p id=x046 class=summary>We have benefits and beneficiary as a proposed set of concepts from the inception of DPV in 2018. The intention was to indicate who 'benefits' from some data being processed i.e. the company or the user.</p>
<p id=x047 class=summary>Prior discussions on this stopped at trying to determine the opposite concept from benefit e.g. harm or detriment, and how to indicate these along with &quot;who is harmed&quot;</p>
<p id=x048 class=summary>Current (today's) proposal is to model these as 'impacts' and indicate the entity being impacted. For e.g. for benefits, this becomes the beneficiary. For harms, this becomes the person harmed.</p>
<p id=x049 class=summary>---</p>
<p id=x050 class=summary><strong>Risk Concepts</strong></p>
<p id=x051 class=summary>DPV models risks and mitigations as broad concepts (<code>Concept hasRisk Risk</code>) (<code>RiskMitigationMeasure mitigatesRisk Risk</code>) (<code>Risk isMitigatedByMeasure RiskMitigationMeasure</code>) and (<code>Concept hasRiskMitigationMeasure RiskMitigationMeasure</code>)</p>
<p id=x052 class=summary>To model additional information, such as likelihood, frequency, consequence and impacts of risks (e.g. data breaches) - this requires concepts associated with risk assessment and risk management</p>
<p id=x053 class=summary>We invite proposals for an extension to the DPV to model risk related concepts (as above, including impacts such as benefits) to be shared via the public mailing list</p>
<p id=x054 class=summary>---</p>
<p id=x055 class=summary><strong>Order of Things</strong></p>
<p id=x056 class=summary>The use-case was how to express order of 'things' i.e. whether they occur before or after something. This is more generic than modelling activities that take place in a sequence as part of a workflow.</p>
<p id=x057 class=summary>The proposal was to provide concepts <code>isBefore</code> and <code>isAfter</code> to indicate something comes before or after within some (unspecified) context. This could be temporal, spatial, or another context.</p>
<p id=x058 class=summary>These were chosen to be more simple and lesser ambiguous than alternatives <code>followsFrom</code></p>
<p id=x059 class=summary>---</p>
<p id=x060 class=summary><strong>isRequiredFor relation expressing requirement for obligation</strong></p>
<p id=x062 class=summary>Julian had proposed a concept <code>isRequiredFor</code> to indicate a measure was required for some legal obligation or requirement</p>
<p id=x063 class=summary>However, this is complex to represent as such requirements could be applicable to things other than technical measures e.g. legal basis, purposes, processing</p>
<p id=x064 class=summary>Additionally, this would necessitate DPV to model legal obligations, compliance processes and status.</p>
<p id=x065 class=summary>This requires more clear proposals with description for what concepts are necessary and how they should fit within the existing model (of concepts in DPV)</p>
<p id=x066 class=summary>Proposals are welcome to be shared through the public mailing list</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x068 class=summary>We will continue discussion on the resolution of proposed concepts next week</p>
<p id=x069 class=summary>Next meeting will take place on MAR-09 13:00 WET / 14:00 CET</p>
