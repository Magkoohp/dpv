<section>
<h3 id=t01>Welcome &amp; Introduction</h3>
<p id=x007 class=irc><cite>&lt;AxelPolleres&gt;</cite> Webex … we wait for Bert to establish a room for us</p>
<p id=x008 class=summary>Start with a quick introductory round</p>
<p id=x009 class=summary>Eva from ULD Germany, working in SPECIAL project</p>
<p id=x010 class=summary>Rigo, working for W3C and ERCIM</p>
<p id=x011 class=summary>Bart, also from ULD, just joined the group</p>
<p id=x012 class=summary>Niklas, from WU, working in the Expedite project</p>
<p id=x013 class=summary>Fajar, from TU Vienna, working also in the Expedite project</p>
<p id=x014 class=irc><cite>&lt;simonstey&gt;</cite> Simon, PhD @ WU Vienna &amp; working as research scientist at Siemens</p>
<p id=x015 class=summary>Javier, from WU, working in the SPECIAL project</p>
<p id=x016 class=summary>Martin, from DT, working in the SPECIAL project</p>
<p id=x018 class=summary>Amr, phD student in TU, working in WU in the SPECIAL project</p>
<p id=x020 class=summary>Axel, working in WU, SPECIAL project</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> the main goal is to fill the vocabularies with content<br>
<span id=x024>… I would suggest to start from the use cases</span><br>
<span id=x025>… Axel going trough the agenda: <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/F2FVienna3Dec:Agenda">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>community/<wbr>dpvcg/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>F2FVienna3Dec:Agenda</a></span></p>
<p id=x026 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> the purpose discussion is probably connected to the legal ground (tomorrow)... we can maybe start on purposes but I expect to already talk of legal ground</p>
<p id=x030 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> we keep this on mind, it makes sense<br>
<span id=x031>… I agree that these concepts are all connected, so might want to connect them in the discussion</span><br>
<span id=x032>… At 17 we have the meetup, one speaker is sick but maybe Rigo can jump in</span><br>
<span id=x033>… as for the lunch, please send the receipt to ERCIM who will kindly sponsor it</span></p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> Maybe we can start with an overview on where we are, also to give an update to my new colleague</p>
<p id=x047 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> We started the group at the same time of the start of the GDPR coming into effect<br>
<span id=x048>… Idea was to standardise certain vocabularies around terminology used in GDPR, to describe the purposes, the different types of personal data, consent, legitime interest...</span><br>
<span id=x049>… all starting from a personal F2F meeting here in Vienna</span><br>
<span id=x050>… Since then we had several telcos (bi-weekly), also a meeting in the mydata conference (e.g. Elmar)</span><br>
<span id=x051>… there is an IRC channel (this), a mailing list (with an archive as well), a wiki, an internal version accessing with W3C account, the minutes of our meetings..</span><br>
<span id=x052>… we collect actions in the &quot;Tracker&quot;</span><br>
<span id=x053>… We agreed on the scope of the group: focus on categories of personal data (we also talked of instance data, e.g dates of birth, for data portability... still to clarify), purposes for personal data hadling, processing involved, data subjects, controllers, processors and recipients, storage and security aspects (location, duration, security measures)</span><br>
<span id=x054>… and last, means of legitimation for personal data processing (content, legitime interest, etc.)</span><br>
<span id=x055>… See these points at: <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2018Nov/0000.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2018Nov/<wbr>0000.html</a></span><br>
<span id=x056>… Then we started to collect use cases: <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/Use-Cases,_Requirements,_Vocabularies">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>community/<wbr>dpvcg/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Use-Cases,_Requirements,_Vocabularies</a></span><br>
<span id=x057>… most of them from SPECIAL and DECODE</span><br>
<span id=x058>… We also collected different vocabularies including such terms, as we don't want to repeat efforts (and mistakes)</span></p>
<p id=x059 class="phone s03"><cite>Hash:</cite> Maybe we go to the taxonomies first</p>
<p id=x063 class="phone s03"><cite>Hash:</cite> we agreed on some taxonomies: approved means approved during the telcos<br>
<span id=x064>… I tried to identify categories and terms in each of them</span><br>
<span id=x065>… There is commonality in most of them, but the structure is different</span><br>
<span id=x066>… a very structure new ontology might not align well with this</span></p>
<p id=x067 class=irc><cite>&lt;rigo&gt;</cite> I opened my personal room on webex <a href="https://mit.webex.com/meet/rigo">https://<wbr>mit.webex.com/<wbr>meet/<wbr>rigo</a></p>
<p id=x068 class="phone s04"><cite>Taxonomy:</cite> <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/Taxonomy">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>community/<wbr>dpvcg/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Taxonomy</a></p>
<p id=x070 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> if you want an ontology of what personal data is, you have to look into vcard and P3P with a full range of personal data (by microsoft), related to profiling....<br>
<span id=x071>… but this is boling the ocean (thousands of terms). That's why we use Linked Data to start some island and connect them</span></p>
<p id=x072 class=irc><cite>&lt;rigo&gt;</cite> meeting number is 640 414 996</p>
<p id=x073 class="phone s06"><cite>Harsh:</cite> Agree, it is very challenging to create such categories</p>
<p id=x074 class="phone s07"><cite>Niklas:</cite> agree, sometimes is more the association with the id rather than the data itself</p>
<p id=x075 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> is a moving target, the decision is always context dependent and depends on the link to other information</p>
<p id=x076 class="phone s07"><cite>Niklas:</cite> it depends on the processing more than the context</p>
<p id=x077 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> What is approved in the wiki?</p>
<p id=x078 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> It is &quot;approved for discussion&quot;, or &quot;in scope&quot;</p>
<p id=x079 class="phone s08"><cite>Bud:</cite> how can one access the wiki?</p>
<p id=x080 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> W3C credentials</p>
<p id=x081 class="phone s06"><cite>harsh:</cite> there are many categories in privacy policies (online service, etc.) and there are techniques to extract terms from them (the legal documents). But I'm not familiar with it... does anyone know a bit more?</p>
<p id=x082 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> I think we need to provide the general framework such that people can plug in</p>
<p id=x083 class="phone s07"><cite>Niklas:</cite> People can build upon our initial set of categories</p>
<p id=x084 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> I would suggest to go to the use cases first and see what is in scope</p>
<p id=x085 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> I would suggest to go to the use cases and identify this island. And use vcard first</p>
<p id=x086 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> But there is an RDF version of vcard and not really new 2011</p>
<p id=x088 class="phone s09"><cite>fajar:</cite> There is a version for 2014<br>
<span id=x089>… Interest group note: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>TR/<wbr>vcard-rdf/</a></span></p>
<p id=x090 class=irc><cite>&lt;Fajar&gt;</cite> vcard ontology: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf/">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>TR/<wbr>vcard-rdf/</a></p>
<p id=x091 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> Probably it doesn't contain all we might need</p>
<p id=x093 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> but that's why we have these island<br>
<span id=x094>… and Linked Data, to find terms that already exists</span></p>
<p id=x096 class="phone s10"><cite>Javier:</cite> We did something similar already with an extension of SPECIAL categories (data, purpose...) for a smart city scenario<br>
<span id=x097>… (project cityspin: <a href="http://cityspin.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/D6.1-Privacy-policy-formalization.pdf)">http://<wbr>cityspin.net/<wbr>wp-content/<wbr>uploads/<wbr>2017/<wbr>10/<wbr>D6.1-Privacy-policy-formalization.pdf)</a></span></p>
<p id=x099 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> And we can use the w3c namespaces for this<br>
<span id=x100>… It is more a social issue rather than a technical issue</span></p>
<p id=x101 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> Maybe we should look more at vcard (will add to the wiki) indeed</p>
<p id=x102 class="phone s06"><cite>Harsh:</cite> but vcard looks at the data of a user, not the personal data category per se</p>
<p id=x103 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> It is easier to look at the real instance data rather than categorize the world. In a second phrase we need to look at the personal data</p>
<p id=x104 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> We should also consider the time dimension, relation to data and person in the context of the time</p>
<p id=x105 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> There is not a standard version to add the context (quads being one of them). There are many, we just need to choose one</p>
<p id=x106 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> Note that we need to point to the version of the vocabulary being reused (e.g. see at the different foaf versions)</p>
<p id=x108 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> our role is to help the &quot;judge&quot; to look at the very fine details. The only think we have to do is to record the version that applies at certain point of time<br>
<span id=x109>… by provenance</span></p>
<p id=x110 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> we need to manage the vocabularies in a way that supports versioning (which is fine, we have the knowledge and experience on that)</p>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Check Actions (mostly related to use cases)</h3>
<p id=x112 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> start with Thomson Reuters' use case: <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/SPECIAL/TR_use_case">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>community/<wbr>dpvcg/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>SPECIAL/<wbr>TR_use_case</a></p>
<p id=x119 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> describe the TR use case. Know your Costumer, maximise the info of your costumer in the financial domain (basically for trustworthiness)<br>
<span id=x120>… basically for legal entities, nor physical persons</span><br>
<span id=x121>… they want to compute the risk level of a legal entity</span><br>
<span id=x122>… (going through the types of data in <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/dpvcg/wiki/SPECIAL/TR_use_case)">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>community/<wbr>dpvcg/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>SPECIAL/<wbr>TR_use_case)</a></span></p>
<p id=x123 class=irc><cite>&lt;Fajar&gt;</cite> ... same personal document in different regions might have different attributes (e.g., birth document)</p>
<p id=x124 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> They are having troubles allocating data to specific sources</p>
<p id=x125 class="phone s07"><cite>Niklas:</cite> Note that once you have some basic information, you can derive new data... this is very relevant</p>
<p id=x126 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> There is article 14th of GDPR that applies when you collect from different sources</p>
<p id=x127 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> we are creating an infrastructure for people that want to do the things right, it is a different scenario</p>
<p id=x128 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> But if collecting public information is subject to GPDR we have to consider it</p>
<p id=x129 class=irc><cite>&lt;rigoo&gt;</cite> WEF data categorization only makes sense for blocking tools and other defensive PETs</p>
<p id=x131 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> sometimes the info of a company is personal information, e.g. if there is a company of only one person<br>
<span id=x132>… also another point to consider in the use case is that, if you have the copy of the passport, you have the full information (not only the ID)</span></p>
<p id=x133 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> but if you don't use it, maybe it is not needed to represent</p>
<p id=x134 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> But data collection matters</p>
<p id=x135 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> but we can have some &quot;rules&quot;, e.g if we have one item of this category, this implies that we have also more information</p>
<p id=x136 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> it is really use case dependent</p>
<p id=x137 class="phone s09"><cite>Fajar:</cite> what I got from Eva is that it is really different e.g. to fill the ID of a passport in an online form or to have the full picture of the passport as you can have all even if you only need the ID</p>
<p id=x138 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> in our use case description (in the website), the description is not complete (with the picture you have more data items potentially)</p>
<p id=x139 class=irc><cite>&lt;rigoo&gt;</cite> we are back in categories vs instance data</p>
<p id=x141 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> what we need then is this kind of implications to know that from an image of a passport you can get X, Y, Z</p>
<p id=x144 class="phone s11"><cite>Simon:</cite> agreed with Axel, if the action is collecting a picture of the passport, then this implies that X, Y, Z information is also collected</p>
<p id=x146 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> what we need to capture is the kind of information that is relevant when the GDPR applies: processing of personal information</p>
<p id=x147 class=irc><cite>&lt;rigo&gt;</cite> I tried to invite zakim, but he's recalcitrant</p>
<p id=x150 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> i.e. operations on personal data (collection,adapting...)<br>
<span id=x151>… collection is also a processing</span><br>
<span id=x152>… The important aspect is to understand that GDPR does not only apply when using the data... also collecting</span></p>
<p id=x154 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> Agreed, I was suggesting to have this implicit information in the categories, but maybe it is too use case specific (e.g. sometimes the religion is in the passport, sometimes not...)</p>
<p id=x155 class="phone s08"><cite>Bud:</cite> For passport, some info is standard (e.g. to read it electronically)</p>
<p id=x156 class=irc><cite>&lt;simonstey&gt;</cite> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document">https://<wbr>en.wikipedia.org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Identity_document</a></p>
<p id=x157 class=irc><cite>&lt;simonstey&gt;</cite> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identity_cards_in_the_European_Economic_Area">https://<wbr>en.wikipedia.org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>National_identity_cards_in_the_European_Economic_Area</a></p>
<p id=x158 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> Bud, it would be good to have these standards</p>
<p id=x159 class=irc><cite>&lt;simonstey&gt;</cite> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Register_of_Travel_and_Identity_Documents_Online">https://<wbr>en.wikipedia.org/<wbr>wiki/<wbr>Public_Register_of_Travel_and_Identity_Documents_Online</a></p>
<p id=x160 class="phone s08"><cite>Bud:</cite> e-ids... it depends on the country</p>
<p id=x161 class=irc><cite>&lt;simonstey&gt;</cite> <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/prado/en/prado-start-page.html#">https://<wbr>www.consilium.europa.eu/<wbr>prado/<wbr>en/<wbr>prado-start-page.html#</a></p>
<p id=x162 class="phone s06"><cite>Harsh:</cite> what about birth certificates?</p>
<p id=x165 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> not standard, e.g. in Austria you can infer the marital status of the parents<br>
<span id=x166>… maybe the representation is standard, but there are some inferences that are implicit</span><br>
<span id=x167>… it is a very nice work, to collect the kind of info you can collect from these documents</span></p>
<p id=x168 class=irc><cite>&lt;simonstey&gt;</cite> austrian documents <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/prado/en/prado-documents/AUT/index.html">https://<wbr>www.consilium.europa.eu/<wbr>prado/<wbr>en/<wbr>prado-documents/<wbr>AUT/<wbr>index.html</a></p>
<p id=x170 class=irc><cite>&lt;rigoo&gt;</cite> no zakim so far</p>
<p id=x171 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> as a CG, it is a good exercise to collect the personal information tht can be inferred from another one</p>
<p id=x172 class="phone s11"><cite>Simon:</cite> I pasted links in IRC (prado coming from EU, an extensive list of possible documents, e.g. weapons cards, driving license...)</p>
<p id=x173 class=irc><cite>&lt;Niklas_&gt;</cite> we should also take a look at this: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2018-11/ISA2%20Study_GDPR%20Data%20Portability%20and%20Core%20Vocabularies_November%202018_1.pdf">https://<wbr>joinup.ec.europa.eu/<wbr>sites/<wbr>default/<wbr>files/<wbr>document/<wbr>2018-11/<wbr>ISA2%20Study_GDPR%20Data%20Portability%20and%20Core%20Vocabularies_November%202018_1.pdf</a></p>
<p id=x174 class="phone s08"><cite>Bud:</cite> the inference is very difficult, normally is linked to other thinks, and the more I link, the more you can infer</p>
<p id=x175 class=irc><cite>&lt;dlewis&gt;</cite> pointer on what might inferred just from people's names from an internationalisation perspective: <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names">https://<wbr>www.w3.org/<wbr>International/<wbr>questions/<wbr>qa-personal-names</a></p>
<p id=x177 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> From previous work (P3P..) we had three points to standardize: personal data is one of them with sticky policies (link policy with the data), then the object data with processing and what you can do with it, and then the policy and finally the instance data and how to package all together<br>
<span id=x178>… for data we are open, here are some hints (with some core), .... but I understand that we need to define the space of expression that it is given by the GDPR</span></p>
<p id=x179 class="phone s07"><cite>Niklas:</cite> is sensitive data clearly defined in GDPR</p>
<p id=x181 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> 2 categories, (i) as defined by article 9, very finite, (ii) and dangerous aspects not mentioned by article 9 such as location data<br>
<span id=x182>… e.g. location data is extremely sensitive (e.g. gender violence) but it is not sensitive within GDPR</span></p>
<p id=x183 class="phone s08"><cite>Bud:</cite> In article 9, there are the conditions when there is a extremely risk.... and I think you can identify location with these conditions</p>
<p id=x184 class="phone s05"><cite>Rigo:</cite> Interesting to consider</p>
<p id=x185 class=irc><cite>&lt;Eva__ULD_&gt;</cite> Bud mentions the Art.29 working Party's Opinion about Data Protection Impact Assessments, they list items and conditions where high risk can be assumed, location being part of it</p>
<p id=x186 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> So we need the concrete terms in Art 9 + the conditions if we need to categorize sensitive in our taxonomies</p>
<p id=x187 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> Similarly than the documents, we can collect also some examples of potentially sensitive inferenced data: e.g. if we know that a person visits this place and it is a religious place, then....</p>
<p id=x188 class="phone s06"><cite>harsh:</cite> Do we need to collect some cases of integration, e.g. location+religious=....</p>
<p id=x191 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> we can maybe first collect the sensitive attributes in our use case. And then see which attributes co-occur and leads to well-known inferred knowledge<br>
<span id=x192>… to say that there is a potential risk</span></p>
<p id=x195 class="phone s08"><cite>Bud:</cite> It is not only that the attribute is sensitive... In risk assessment in Data protection you have the parties interested, how often you collect, etc. how sensitive something is... is not only about the attribute</p>
<p id=x198 class="phone s09"><cite>Fajar:</cite> You have to consider the context in order to describe the risk</p>
<p id=x199 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> Maybe interesting research wise, but for the standard is mostly the attributes themselves</p>
<p id=x201 class=irc><cite>&lt;simonstey&gt;</cite> present Fajar_Ekaputra Javier_Fernandez Martin_Kurze Amr_Azzam</p>
<p id=x207 class="phone s12"><cite>Dave:</cite> There is also a kind of preprocessing, first you contextualise the use case, decide what is personal data and sensitive and then put it in the taxonomy</p>
<p id=x208 class="phone s01"><cite>Axel:</cite> TR is mostly about the attributes collected in the use case page, let's switch to another use case to have another perspective (deutsche telekom)</p>
<p id=a01 class=action><strong>ACTION:</strong> Eva to look into requirements of data protection assessment, and whether it would make sense to formalize that in terms of what we standardize</p>

<p id=x311 class="phone s15"><cite>AxelPolleres:</cite> I put something in the IRC regarding a proposal for the Data categories - we should start collecting attribute names such as location, dob, a description of what that is (natural language), and whether it already exists in some existing ontology (eg. vcard) and a data type or range (eg. geo-co-ordinates)</p>
<p id=x312 class="phone s15"><cite>AxelPolleres:</cite> and the typical temporal extent (eg. how often this changes)</p>
<p id=x313 class="phone s15"><cite>AxelPolleres:</cite> this could be the starting point to collect the core attributes</p>
<p id=x314 class="phone s09"><cite>Fajar:</cite> Should we only describe the abstract data or also specific data eg. bank account contains other attributes, then what should be included in the data definition?</p>
<p id=x315 class="phone s05"><cite>rigo:</cite> this depnds on the use-case. You can have all kinds of data organised in a hierarchy, and if someone links only the top concepts, the structure is lost</p>
<p id=x316 class="phone s17"><cite>dlewis:</cite> you start with saying it is a composite object with an anchor (e.g. phone number) and you specify whether it is a strong or a weak anchor</p>

<p id=x321 class="phone s09"><cite>fajar:</cite> should we only add the data/instance e.g. phone number or also model/add information on what can be derived / added to the phone number?</p>
<p id=x322 class="phone s15"><cite>AxelPolleres:</cite> we are making this hard for ourselves. In principle, we are looking for data that is one or two hops away from the person (in terms of graph) e.g. bank A/C number</p>
<p id=x323 class="phone s15"><cite>AxelPolleres:</cite> attributes also mean chains that can be traced back to the individual, and in the description we say what the chain is</p>
<p id=x324 class="phone s05"><cite>rigo:</cite> this is an application of linked data: following the edges</p>
<p id=x325 class="phone s09"><cite>fajar:</cite> but then we can run chains of any length</p>

<p id=x329 class="phone s05"><cite>rigo:</cite> to summarise - for personal data, we have a simplified defintion as attributes connected to a person somehow</p>

<p id=x338 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> moving to discussion regarding Purposes</p>
<p id=x339 class=irc><cite>&lt;DPVCG-desktopPC&gt;</cite> What is a purpose?</p>
<p id=x340 class="phone s05"><cite>rigo:</cite> Purpose is what is the policy data - what are you doing with the data</p>
<p id=x341 class="phone s05"><cite>rigo:</cite> we should widen the scope to talk about retention time etc.</p>
<p id=x342 class=irc><cite>&lt;Javier&gt;</cite> Javier: definition of personal data by GDPR is very important as it says &quot;any data&quot; related to PII, directly or indirectly (it does not matter if the data can directly identify you)</p>
<p id=x343 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> purpose is the question &quot;why&quot; so it is the goal for processing - the controller wants to do something</p>
<p id=x344 class=irc><cite>&lt;rigoo&gt;</cite> identifiable data is defined in consideration 26 of GDPR:</p>
<p id=x345 class=irc><cite>&lt;rigoo&gt;</cite> To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly.</p>
<p id=x346 class="phone s05"><cite>rigo:</cite> in P3P we used &quot;current purpose&quot; and GDPR has reference to this as to fulfil contract or obligation which is an abstract for the current activity. To have a declarative logic there, we have to define all purposes, which are infinite</p>
<p id=x347 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> we should try to derive classical purposes from the use-cases</p>
<p id=x348 class="phone s15"><cite>AxelPolleres:</cite> starting point is purposes from P3P</p>
<p id=x349 class="phone s15"><cite>AxelPolleres:</cite> (showing MyData logo) the icons categorise the personal data (maybe in its context)</p>

<p id=x370 class=irc><cite>&lt;DPVCG-desktopPC&gt;</cite> purposes could be classified along the beneficiary... e.g. improving of the user experience, vs. optimization of a service in order to make it more cost effective to the provider</p>
<p id=x371 class="phone s05"><cite>rigo:</cite> it is a legal matter for being specific vs being abstract; we have to be able to express whatever the outcome i.e. it should be abstract as well as specific in terms of level</p>

<p id=x374 class="phone s09"><cite>fajar:</cite> And the organisation can then extend these to be more specific to their services</p>
<p id=x375 class="phone s02"><cite>Eva:</cite> we can show this using our use-case (how to extend)</p>
<p id=x376 class="phone s15"><cite>AxelPolleres:</cite> whether the purpose is specific or abstract depends on the context e.g. service provision</p>
