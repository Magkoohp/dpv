## Noting Minutes

Minutes can be noted using IRC manually, or using the channel `#dpvcg` on https://irc.w3.org/ that provides various bots with scribes features. See https://harshp.com/dev/webdev/w3c-irc for a short guide on commands and formatting useful for taking minutes with the W3C tools.

The filename for minutes must be of the form `meeting-YYYY-MM-DD.[irc/txt/wiki]`. If there are optional contexts to be added, e.g. workshop, or common meeting at TPAC or ODRL, then these should be added as a suffix to preserve the sortability of minutes based on dates in filename.

## Generating Minutes

1. Get the minutes from IRC tool or download it from w3c IRC
2. save it in `./generator/data/` with the filename `meeting-YYYY-MM-DD.irc`
3. run `./generator/generate_minutes.sh` - this will produce HTMLs in `/meetings/`
4. run `./generator/generate_index.py` - this will update `index.html` in `/meetings/`

- If you have write access, directly add the minutes. Otherwise open a PR with the IRC log and HTML files

## Behind the scenes

Minutes are generated using the w3c scribe tool, see the guide at https://w3c.github.io/scribe/scribedoc.htm. The tool supports minutes generated from manual notes, IRC output including those generated by w3c tools. These are collected within the `generator/data` folder. The command used to generate the minutes document is:

```
# path: /meetings/generator
perl scribe.perl -implicitContinuations -final -emphasis <log.txt> > <minutes-YYYY-MM-DD.html>
```
