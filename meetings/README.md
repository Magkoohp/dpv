## Noting Minutes

Minutes can be noted using IRC manually, or using the channel `#dpvcg` on https://irc.w3.org/ that provides various bots with scribes features. See https://harshp.com/dev/webdev/w3c-irc for a short guide on commands and formatting useful for taking minutes with the W3C tools.

The filename for minutes must be of the form `meeting-YYYY-MM-DD.[irc/txt/wiki]`. If there are optional contexts to be added, e.g. workshop, or common meeting at TPAC or ODRL, then these should be added as a suffix to preserve the sortability of minutes based on dates in filename.

## Generating Minutes

Minutes are generated using the w3c scribe tool, see the guide at https://w3c.github.io/scribe/scribedoc.htm. The tool supports minutes generated from manual notes, IRC output including those generated by w3c tools. These are collected within the `generator/data` folder. The command used to generate the minutes document is:

```
perl code/scribe.perl -implicitContinuations -final -emphasis <log.txt> > <minutes-YYYY-MM-DD.html>
```

## Adding Minutes here

Add the minutes log file in `code/data`, run `generator/scribe.perl` to generate the HTML in this folder, and then run `generator/generate_index.py` to generate the index HTML.

If you have write access, directly add the minutes. Otherwise open a PR.
