<section>
<h3 id=t01>Break and Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x010 class=summary>Owing to the breaks and vacations around end of year, we will skip the next few meetings, and meet on 4th January.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Location vocabulary for DPV-Legal</h3>
<p id=x013 class=summary>In continuation of the ongoing discussion of which authoritative vocabulary we can use (see summary at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/46),">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>w3c/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>issues/<wbr>46),</a> we currently only have EU with no guidance on how to use it in our work.</p>
<p id=x014 class=summary>There are concepts in the EU vocabs, but it is complex to understand them and use them.</p>
<p id=x015 class=summary>For now, we make a note in the DPV-Legal spec that we are exploring options, contributions welcome, and continue providing information not available elsewhere.</p>
<p id=x016 class=summary>This is information about laws and authorities mostly, as well as any inverse relationships not present in the EU vocab graphs.</p>
<p id=x017 class=summary>The added benefit could also be to provide all the relevant metadata in single dataset/files.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Risk Extension</h3>
<p id=x019 class=summary>For completion of the risk extension, there are some pending proposals for concepts from ISO 31000 regarding risk management that are to be added. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/74">w3c/<wbr>dpv#74</a></p>
<p id=x020 class=summary>Along with this, we were also supposed to look into extending Justifications (currently they relate only to rights).</p>
<p id=x021 class=summary>The group discussed the relevance and usefulness of justifications, and has decided to provide them externally as an informative list for use across use-cases.</p>
<p id=x022 class=summary>That is, there will be a new extension called justifications.</p>
<p id=x023 class=summary>Regarding benefits, the group discussed what is a <code>benefit</code> and how it is distinguished from <code>purpose</code>.</p>
<p id=x024 class=summary>The arguments were that purposes are implied as benefits i.e. desirable, since we have optimisation and personalisation as examples.</p>
<p id=x025 class=summary>However, (harsh suggests) benefits should be the impact and not the consequence, i.e. it should describe how an entity is affected.</p>
<p id=x026 class=summary>In this case, optimisation and personalisation are consequences, not impacts, and benefits should be modelled as impacts.</p>
<p id=x027 class=summary>There was at length discussion on this, especially around how benefits such as loyalty programmes, and rewards, and gifts, discounts, etc. should be modelled. We want to be careful in this to avoid ambiguity in use and misleading expressions.</p>
<p id=x028 class=summary>The group has decided to first explore the intended meaning of 'benefit' and to then look into producing taxonomies.</p>
<p id=x029 class=summary>Harsh has agreed to send an email explaining his position on benefits being distinct from 'consequences' such as personalisation and optimisation.</p>
<p id=x030 class=summary>Additional notes - for DPV-legal, we will add links to other vocabularies to welcome contributions, especially DBPedia and Wikidata, and establish guidance on how to use languages, labels, flags, etc. associated with regions.</p>
