<h3 id=t02>Proposed Concepts for Data Transfers</h3>
<p id=x014 class=summary>David's email AUG-20 <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2021Aug/0007.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2021Aug/<wbr>0007.html</a> with spreadsheet</p>
<p id=x015 class="phone s01"><cite>David:</cite> (shared screen of spreadsheet) Data Exporter/Importer is used by EDPB, and therefore these should be defined in DPV</p>
<p id=x016 class="phone s02"><cite>Georg:</cite> Supporting inclusion of these terms</p>
<p id=x018 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> are these concepts global (DPV) or scoped (DPV-GDPR) ?</p>
<p id=x019 class="phone s04"><cite>markL:</cite> would be preferable to have this as global concepts for expressing adequacy</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s02"><cite>Georg:</cite> agree that it should be in DPV<br>
<span id=x022>… (no disagreements on inclusion of these in DPV)</span></p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> inclusion in LegalEntities similar to 'role' as DataController</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> How to clarify definition and scope, e.g. importer relates to extra-judicial third-country data transfer recipient</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s05"><cite>davidH:</cite> agree that this has global relevance, third countries everywhere as non-jurisdictional country</p>
<p id=x026 class="phone s02"><cite>Georg:</cite> In Signatu, there is data transfer with a 'recipient country' classified on jurisdiction (in/out EU). If there is transfer outside EU/EEA, then there is separate legal basis and term data export/import</p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s05"><cite>davidH:</cite> broadening the notion of third country, there is 'recipient country' which can be any country<br>
<span id=x043>… dicussing how closely required the constraint of imported being in a third country is to the definition</span><br>
<span id=x044>… consensus on removing third country, relating data importer to 'recipient country' and including DataExporter and DataImporter</span><br>
<span id=x045>… Next terms - A45, A46, A49 legal bases and  their relation to data transfers</span><br>
<span id=x046>… Suggestion (prior discussions led by Georg) are to structure the DPV-GDPR legal bases as a hierarchy (e.g. legal bases related to consent), and use data transfer legal bases as a similar categorisation</span><br>
<span id=x047>… For this, davidH has proposed adding DataTransferLegalBasis as a category of legal basis (subclass dpv:LegalBasis) within DPV</span><br>
<span id=x048>… Consensus on this proposal, no objections. Term added in spreadsheet for DPV.</span><br>
<span id=x049>… Note on need to restructure DPV-GDPR based on new(-ish) list of legal bases.</span><br>
<span id=x050>… Further categorisations have been proposed along the lines of adequacy (A45), transfers (A46), derogations (A49).</span><br>
<span id=x051>… A discussion on how to express the 'relation' and 'applicability' of legal basis for particular contexts, such as data transfers taking place in third countries without adequacy decisions, took place regarding how to express such terms and relations in DPV</span><br>
<span id=x052>… Whether to include the 'rules', 'constraints', or 'applicability' as some form of taxonomy. Consensus was that at this stage it would introduce complexity, and force using a particular notion (e.g. specifying where legal bases apply)</span><br>
<span id=x053>… Consensus that such explorations can take place outside the DPV and DPV-GDPR documents in a separate extension which can then be merged later depending on correctness and validity.</span><br>
<span id=x054>… Next terms - TransferStartDate and TransferEndDate</span><br>
<span id=x055>… As per earlier conversation in davidH email with feedback by harsh, DPV does not provide 'minor' terms for strings, dates, times, etc. because they vary in their use and application.</span><br>
<span id=x056>… Instead, the 'generic properties' of hasDuration can be used (as is, or specialised) for expressing data transfer durations in terms of start and date with XSD or OWL-TIME.</span></p>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x061 class="phone s05"><cite>davidH:</cite> Discussion stopped due to end of meeting time. Next week discussion continues on terms related to transfer safeguards and supplementary measures.<br>
<span id=x062>… We will have a presentation by Piero Bonatti on work in TRAPEZE, which utilises DPV for expressing policies and checking legal compliance, including consent.</span><br>
<span id=x063>… For expressing disagreements or changes to current consensus on terms, members are welcome to submit comments by end of (this) week.</span><br>
<span id=x064>… Following next week's meeting, the next iteration of DPV (v0.2.x) will be finalised and published.</span></p>
