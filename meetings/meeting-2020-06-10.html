<h2>Meeting minutes</h2>
<section><p id=x006 class=summary>Approval for minutes for MAY-27 (done)</p>
<p id=x012 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> revisiting goals/deliverables for the group</p>
<p id=x013 class="phone s02"><cite>Beatriz:</cite> global alliance for genomics (emails sent by Mark Lizar on mailing list) - not sure on what it means or is proposed</p>
<p id=x014 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> I agree</p>
<p id=x015 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> it would be best to reply to the email and ask for more details/clarity</p>
<p id=x016 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> there was a public call, related to use of DUO ontology including purposes; DUO purposes do not match DPV categories</p>
<p id=x017 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> I agree, DUO purposes contain what we define in DPV as purpose, processing, sometimes recipients. But they can be aligned if needed (IMO)</p>
<p id=x018 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> People from GHA and DPVCG should collaborate and discuss how to move forward - and see whether they would like to use the separation of purpose categories/processing etc as the DPV has done. If yes, then we can combine them within DPV(CG).</p>
<p id=x020 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Mark is on call - so we can discuss this issue here</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> it was not clear about what is proposed - could you clarify the sentence regargind mapping with Global Health Alliance?</p>
<p id=x022 class="phone s04"><cite>email:</cite> <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2020Jun/0004.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2020Jun/<wbr>0004.html</a></p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> the goal is to use DPV to define and/or purposes through mapping</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> what DUO / GHA has done is stich together sentences with multiple elements. So first activity would be to ask the GHA people if they see separation as in DPV is useful for them and then do the mapping.</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> The project we are working are involved in a project called Molecular You for medical research in British Columbia which uses Blockchain and DUO. The goal is to make a digital ledger for consent. GH4Ga is part of the project / they consult.</p>
<p id=x026 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> Anadi (from that group) has tried to do a test mapping</p>
<p id=x027 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> it is tricky for research related to genetics which also includes family genetic information or emotions; and these are valuable to distill separately as a research problem; and then we can think about doing this with DPV</p>
<p id=x028 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> the approach is different here where DPV can be used as a code of conduct in GH4GH in order to provide consent for medical reearch</p>
<p id=x029 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> from your perspective, what are you proposing as next steps for DPVCG?</p>
<p id=x030 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> mapping with GH4GH for DPV - and then liasing with them to work on this (summarised sentence)</p>
<p id=x031 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> we could set up a call to do this</p>
<p id=x032 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> We should discuss more on this through the mailing list in terms of interest, clarification, and work involved</p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Moving to topic of the group's deliverables and timelines - we should update these.</p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> I propose to focus on use-cases, how DPV can be improved, and disseminating it to adopters for specific use-cases</p>
<p id=x035 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> (regarding ISO/IEC 29184) as an use-case and also the work been done at Kantara</p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> expressing concern that DPV(CG) should not work in such a way to become dependant on a license with ISO</p>
<p id=x037 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> I agree we don't want licensing, but ISO represents consensus with large players which is important</p>
<p id=x038 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> to clarify, I think we should incorporate requirements from an international standard as an use-case and ensure DPV can provide e.g. machine-readable vocabulary for privacy/consent notices</p>
<p id=x039 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> that clarifies the issue for me</p>
<p id=x040 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> anyone can access ISO documents through participation in (some) group - which I will send to the group's public mailing list</p>
<p id=x041 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> (reg. ISO) after confirmation with Colin at Kantara</p>
<p id=x043 class="phone s05"><cite>Mark:</cite> we worked on ISO to DPV extension using GDPR, and we were waiting for ISO 29184 to create an ISO to GDPR (with DPV mapping in appendix) to provide a single mapping source for vocabularies<br>
<span id=x044>… This is involved in the summer project for the GH4GH</span></p>
<p id=x045 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Item 3 on the agenda was ISO/IEC - which we have discussed</p>
<p id=x046 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> My argument for DPV is that we should map to a single agreed international standard - which is ISO instead of attempting to add individual jurisdictions/</p>
<p id=x047 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> I would like to bring attention to transfer legal basis submitted by Signatu and see them added to the DPV</p>
<p id=x048 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> I would suggest sending a reminder email to the mailing list and CC'ng legal experts to get it validated. We can then do the technical work on incorporating it.</p>
<p id=x049 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> Article 13/14 regarding information to be provided - should also be incorporated / addressed by DPVCG.</p>
<p id=x050 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> Whether DPV is fully aligned to specify this information. IF not, we should assess whether DPV should include this information.</p>
<p id=x053 class="phone s03"><cite>Georg:</cite> currently DPV lists elements comprising Data Processing Handling - but it does not say (in much detail) regarding relations between elements. It could be worthwhile to have a discussion to see if it is useful.</p>
<p id=x056 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> is this about a relation between e.g. processing and data category or processing and purpose? Georg: Yes.<br>
<span id=x057>… Georg sharing screen to display diagram about relations</span><br>
<span id=x058>… examples on screen: data storage, sensitive associated with data</span></p>
<p id=x059 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> We have had this discussion which influenced the design of separate concepts and a single concept intersection them (i.e. PersonalDataHandling)</p>
<p id=x060 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Georg can share the relations / diagram to the group to say/show which relations are not considered or possible</p>
<p id=i01 class=issue><strong>ISSUE:</strong> Article 13/14 requirements using DPV</p>
