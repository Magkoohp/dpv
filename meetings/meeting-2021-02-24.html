<h3 id=t01>Issues/Actions listed in W3C tracker</h3>
<p id=x011 class="phone s01"><cite>beatriz:</cite> I attended the ANCR (Kantara WG), and they are interested in primer and contributing to use-cases</p>
<p id=x013 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> Signatu is currently participating in a competition for PbD (design, default), and our use-case involves DPV. So this would be good to the community (DPVCG).</p>
<p id=x014 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> Consent is not only a token (in response), but also includes/requires information about what the consent is about (info/metadata)</p>
<p id=x015 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> The problem is package / container, so my suggestion or advice to the consent people is to provide us with a container</p>
<p id=x016 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> Is consent receipt / record (or whatever the standard/spec ends up being called) a solution or approach here?</p>
<p id=x017 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> Currently, we have consent receipt/record as a transaction, and though it is supported in more technical possibilities, we aren't providing it yet</p>
<p id=x018 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> I'm involved in a project called MOSAIcROWN <a href="https://mosaicrown.eu/">https://<wbr>mosaicrown.eu/</a></p>
<p id=x019 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> This involves recording the semantics/info about use-case (e.g. analytics for a charging station) in connection with consent</p>
<p id=x020 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> we're implementing sticky policies, so one could point to the policy for all pertinent demonstration/proof/record</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> I'm working on a project related to consent (privacy as expected <a href="https://privacy-as-expected.org/)">https://<wbr>privacy-as-expected.org/)</a> which also involves consent records</p>
<p id=x022 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> And the problem is that there can be many efforts, but they need to satisfy legal requirements and be auditable. E.g. there's CR v1.1, there's ISO 27560 in progress, Kantara has another WG for consent receipts</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> And I remember when we were doing DPV v0.1 via workshop/meeting, we had consent receipt on the agenda. Maybe now is a good time to resume the effort?</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> 20 years ago in P3P, there was a consent key field with info about 5 (purposes) which might be suitable for a use-case, but wouldn't scale or be applicable to practical use-cases</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> Signatu has a system where store metadata associated with consent (e.g. purpose, data storage), and you can request key, records, and we can package it to share</p>
<p id=x026 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> There are also other legal bases, which also need to be packaged/used in a similar way.</p>
<p id=x027 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> If you're doing processing in health/medical domain, there is also recording of ethical clearance/advice/report, which is done once and then stored (as reference) in data lake.</p>
<p id=x028 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> for DPV, we have the basis of what is 'processing' i.e. data handling and legal bases. We need to go to the next level now and then think what do we need to specify consent, specify contract.</p>
<p id=x029 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> DNT has a field for consent blob (or can be associated with) that can be used as/to provide receipt. Something to think about / look into.</p>
<p id=x030 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> You should look at using named graphs as a way to capture a 'record' of a transaction or event, this could be a nice way to package RDF since tooling already exists to work with named graphs.</p>
<p id=x031 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> Look at RDF* (rdf-star) <a href="https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-02-18.html">https://<wbr>w3c.github.io/<wbr>rdf-star/<wbr>cg-spec/<wbr>2021-02-18.html</a> to annotate records/triples with information</p>
<p id=x032 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> In the legal domain, property graphs are more analogous than just triples, so RDF* can help specify information with DPV</p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> The Global Health Alliance (GHA) <a href="http://www.ghahealth.com/">http://<wbr>www.ghahealth.com/</a> also uses graphs linked/populated from GitHub, so another resource to look at (for examples/use)</p>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Decision on Action/Issue Tracker</h3>
<p id=x037 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> We will move to GitHub (from currently W3C trackers) as the sole place for listing issues and trackers<br>
<span id=x038>… rigo will be looking into W3C namespace repo for DPVCG on GitHub</span><br>
<span id=x039>… beatriz and harsh will summarise, filter issues/actions and move them to GitHub for record/discussion</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Proposed Terms</h3>
<p id=x041 class="phone s05"><cite>nishad:</cite> does DPV have a term to indicate a related resource (a record) e.g. privacy policy</p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s03"><cite>rigo:</cite> DPV uses the same global namespace schema as RDF for semantics IRIs, so that is the usual identifier used rather than an external resource</p>
<p id=x043 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> for referencing to other resources, there are vocabularies e.g. rdfs:seeAlso or dct:source that are better suited, rather than having DPV duplicate everything</p>
<p id=x044 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> DPV currently does not have a 'privacy policy' term ⟶ something to add to proposed terms?</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Tools shared / discussed today</h3>
<p id=x046 class="phone s05"><cite>nishad:</cite> OntoSpy dpv explorer <a href="https://nishad.github.io/dpv-explorer/">https://<wbr>nishad.github.io/<wbr>dpv-explorer/</a> documentation for dpv</p>
<p id=x047 class="phone s05"><cite>nishad:</cite> <a href="https://github.com/dcmi/dctap">dcmi/<wbr>dctap</a> for specifying restrictions/profiles</p>
<p id=x048 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> OTTR <a href="https://ottr.xyz/">https://<wbr>ottr.xyz/</a> for ontology / templating</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Next Meeting Call</h3>
<p id=x050 class="phone s04"><cite>harsh:</cite> The next meeting call will in 2 weeks, at the usual time: 13:00 WET / 14:00 CET</p>
