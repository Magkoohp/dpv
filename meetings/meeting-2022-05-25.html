<h3 id=t01>Technology Concepts</h3>
<p id=x010 class=summary>In the previous meeting, we stopped the discussion where technology concepts were to be re-ordered to better align with the Processing taxonomy. In this meeting, we continue that discussion.</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s01"><cite>georg:</cite> Why separate technology? It would be better to have this written down as explanation / motivation.<br>
<span id=x024>… Note to write technology extension text specifying: 1) Why we need separation of concepts 2) Relation with Tech/Org Measures 3) Modelling capability vs concept of technology 4) Benefits regarding providing expandable concepts in terms of taxonomy as well as ontological model separate from DPV and 5) Better aligning with sources such as ENISA and ISO</span><br>
<span id=x025>… Harsh presents a different structure for the taxonomy</span><br>
<span id=x026>… Top concepts <code>DataTechnology</code> and <code>ProcessingTechnology</code> that represent technologies acting on data and technologies performing or enabling processing</span><br>
<span id=x027>… These are further expanded as: Data - (same as processing) DataUseTechnology, DataStorageTechnology, etc. Processing - Application, Device, VM, Server, etc. - anything on which processing happens or takes place.</span><br>
<span id=x028>… These two can be combined to specify things such as Server (processing) for Storage (data) as <code>DataStorageServer</code></span><br>
<span id=x029>… Service and Product etc. as <u>market defined terms</u> are removed from scope. Instead, the focus is on modelling how these represent a model of utilising technology, i.e. standalone app or software or a subscription that is continous or sporadically used</span><br>
<span id=x030>… Terms for actors regarding technology - <code>TechnologyProvider</code> for who provides it, <code>TechnologyDeveloper</code> for who develops it, <code>TechnologyUser</code> for who uses it, <code>TechnologySubject</code> for upon whom it is used. These terms are directly related to those defined within the AI Act i.e. AIProvider etc.</span><br>
<span id=x031>… The location where a technology is applied or used is separated as the concept <code>TechnologyLocation</code> to specify things such as on device, on a server, some specific geographical location</span><br>
<span id=x032>… Technologies which provide only an algorithm are specified as <code>AlgorithmicTechnology</code> and those that only provide management are <code>ManagementTechnology</code>.</span><br>
<span id=x033>… A <code>TechnologicalSystem</code> is a technology provided as a system e.g. software or app - it is sufficiently complete on its own, <code>TechnologicalComponent</code> is a technology provided as a component - e.g. plugin or script or library.</span><br>
<span id=x034>… The communication performed by technologies is represented by <code>CommunicationMechanism</code> which specifies how technologies communicate e.g. internet connectivity, wifi, bluetooth, etc.</span><br>
<span id=x035>… To associate technologies with specific concepts in DPV, e.g. processor or TOMS or actors, the property <code>relatedTo</code> is provided as a hint or guidance for where that technology can be useful</span></p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s01"><cite>georg:</cite> In all these, Data Security should be a priority for modelling based on practical needs</p>
<p id=x041 class="phone s02"><cite>julian:</cite> PETs (Privacy Enhancing Technologies) should also be modelled<br>
<span id=x042>… There was a discussion on Data Security vs Data Safety</span><br>
<span id=x043>… We discussed technologies based on how security, safety, and risk management is performed.</span><br>
<span id=x044>… Current proposal is to have SecurityTechnology with subconcepts for SecurityTech - Detection, Prevention, Mitigation, Monitoring</span><br>
<span id=x045>… Where detection refers to identifying vulnerabilities, prevention is preventing those from being exploited, mitigation is reducing impact, and monitoring is identifying if those have taken place</span></p>

<h3 id=t02>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x048 class="phone s02"><cite>julian:</cite> We will meet again in one week, JUN-01 WED 14:00 CEST<br>
<span id=x049>… We will continue the discussion on technologies. This proposal will be cleaned up, organised, and shared by Harsh on the mailing list.</span></p>
