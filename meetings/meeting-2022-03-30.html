<section>
<h3 id=t01>Consequence and Impact concepts</h3>
<p id=x010 class=summary><a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/03/23-dpvcg-minutes.html">Last week we discussed concepts related to Consequences and Impacts, see minutes</a></p>
<p id=x011 class=summary>No further comments or objections on acceptance of those</p>
<p id=x012 class=summary>Regarding Negative Impacts i.e. Harms, the proposal is to distinguish 'Damage' with further specification as 'Material' and 'Non-Material' given their importance in legal proceedings and investigations.</p>
<p id=x013 class=summary>Regarding Consequence, we currently have distinction between consequences arising from success or failure of a context. In cases where neither is applicable, i.e. consequence happens in due course of something without it being intended directly, the proposal is to specify this as <code>ConsequenceAsSideEffect</code>.</p>
<p id=x014 class=summary>These concepts were discussed and accepted. The concepts related to risk and consequences have been structured in to a <u>Risk</u> module in the documentation.</p>
<p id=x015 class="phone s01"><cite>mark:</cite> For consequence as side effect, would this be useful to denote consequence of data stored in another country → yes, it can be used for that with further extensions/specific expression</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Extension for Jurisdictions, Laws, and DPAs</h3>
<p id=x023 class="phone s01"><cite>mark:</cite> The proposal (FEB-24) <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Feb/0006.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Feb/<wbr>0006.html</a> suggested a separate extension (<code>dpv-tech</code>) providing locations (e.g. countries) as jurisdictions with links to relevant laws and DPAs.<br>
<span id=x024>… The data is here <a href="https://github.com/coolharsh55/dpv-x/tree/master/dpv-juris">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>coolharsh55/<wbr>dpv-x/<wbr>tree/<wbr>master/<wbr>dpv-juris</a> and had the review period until MAR-31</span><br>
<span id=x025>… As of now, it contains all countries (based on ISO and UN lists), EU memberships (EU27 and EU28), and expression of GDPR and its applicability in terms of being linked to each of the enforced areas as applicable law, and the relevant Data Protection Authority for each jurisdiction (including German Federal States).</span><br>
<span id=x026>… The term <u>juris</u> has an issue in terms of being also used by several law-related firms and companies. To avoid this, we rename this to <code>dpv-legal</code>.</span><br>
<span id=x027>… These concepts were discussed and accepted. They will be published as &quot;Extension for Jurisdictions, Laws, and Authorities&quot; with prefix <code>dpv-legal</code>.</span><br>
<span id=x028>… For further expansion, we welcome proposals and contributions. Contributors who wish to expand this data can provide their input by referring to existing data e.g. similar country, law, or authority structure.</span><br>
<span id=x029>… Contributors can utilise the existing list of sources <a href="https://github.com/coolharsh55/dpv-x/blob/master/dpv-juris/sources.md">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>coolharsh55/<wbr>dpv-x/<wbr>blob/<wbr>master/<wbr>dpv-juris/<wbr>sources.md</a> to add more concepts/data to this extension.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Extension for Technologies</h3>
<p id=x034 class="phone s01"><cite>mark:</cite> See <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Mar/0010.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Mar/<wbr>0010.html</a> for proposal regarding modelling technologies<br>
<span id=x035>… There is no existing ready-to-adopt list/hierarchy that we can use. Therefore this proposal is opinionated and is based on common use of technologies e.g. for storage, processing, etc.</span><br>
<span id=x036>… In this, there is an overlap between the technologies and technical measures. This is resolved as follows. The technical measures as a theoretical or abstract notation for a measure/process that is used to secure/safeguard data. A technology is the implementation that achieves this.</span><br>
<span id=x037>… There will be overlaps between both, e.g. security can be both technology and technical measure based on what is being done. In this case, it is fine to define them as both, though ideally it would be beneficial to separate them to indicate distinction between a measure and an implementation.</span></p>
<p id=x038 class="phone s02"><cite>paul:</cite> So would the pseudo-anonymisation algorithm used be a technology or a technical measure?</p>
<p id=x040 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> The algorithm itself would be the measure, but its a theoretical measure, but its implementation would be a technology e.g. in some system or as code.<br>
<span id=x041>… We welcome contributions for the more technologies.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Data Subject Categories</h3>
<p id=x047 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> We have a list of proposed data subject categories. Of these, the proposal is to select those that are common and useful to lots of use-cases, and provide them in DPV.<br>
<span id=x048>… Examples include - Adult, Patient, Employee, Citizen, Consumer and so on.</span><br>
<span id=x049>… We have discussed acceptance of - <code>NaturalPerson</code> as the parent concept of other data subject concepts, <code>Adult</code> as the counter to <code>Child</code>, <code>Patient</code>, <code>Employee</code>, <code>Student</code>, <code>Citizen</code>, <code>NonCitizen</code>, <code>Immigrant</code>.</span><br>
<span id=x050>… We have discussed non-acceptance of - <code>Tourist</code></span><br>
<span id=x051>… We have discussed more discussions needed regarding <code>Customer</code> and <code>Consumer</code> and the distinction between these two</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x054 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> We will continue discussion on proposed concepts regarding technologies and data subjects in the next meeting.<br>
<span id=x055>… It will take place on APR-06 14:00 CEST.</span></p>
