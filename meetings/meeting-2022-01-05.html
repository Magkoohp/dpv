<h3 id=t01>DPV Primer draft for review</h3>
<p id=x009 class=summary>See <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Jan/0000.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Jan/<wbr>0000.html</a></p>
<p id=x010 class=summary>Proposal is to have this finalised by month-end JAN-31</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Decision on Personal Data Categories renaming</h3>
<p id=x014 class=summary>Last meeting we agreed to the proposal for changing Personal Data Category to Personal Data and move categories to extension</p>
<p id=x015 class=summary>No comments/objections; accepted and to be integrated into next iteration DPV</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>DataSubject subclasses - awaiting proposal from members</h3>
<p id=x017 class=summary>No updates or proposals from members. Topic postponed to next meeting.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Jurisdictions</h3>
<p id=x019 class=summary>The proposal is to have a concept called Jurisdiction, with sub-categories for Country (e.g. IE), SupraNationalUnion (e.g. EU), EconomicUnion (e.g. EEA), and Region (e.g. California)</p>
<p id=x020 class=summary>Jurisdictions are relevant for where data is stored, where Data Subjects and Controllers are located and so on. Jurisdictions are different from Location (i.e. specific interpretation of Location) to mean that location applies as a legal jurisdiction in terms of its law.</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s01"><cite>jan:</cite> How to specify what Laws apply? e.g. GDPR</p>
<p id=x023 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> Is this regarding specifying Jurisdiction and Laws for a data processing argument? jan: Yes</p>
<p id=x024 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> Proposal - we have a concept 'Law' with property 'hasLaw'. Applied as - &lt; GDPR a Law &gt; . &lt; EU hasLaw GDPR &gt; .</p>
<p id=x025 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> There needs to be nuance in how 'law' is represented and applied since there is also private law, contract law, and others.</p>
<p id=x026 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> Yes, and also whether that law is associated with a jurisidiction because it was passed by the governing body, or is applicable there, its territorial scope, and other nuances.</p>
<p id=x027 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> Proposal - instead of hasLaw, we have the property hasApplicableLaw to indicate some law is the be considered applicable or applied in the context of a concept. For example, indicating the data processing operations consider GDPR to be the applicable law &lt; Policy hasApplicableLaw GDPR &gt; .</p>
<p id=x028 class="phone s04"><cite>julian:</cite> Modelling just Jurisdiction should be sufficient without Country and Region because these are not relevant in specifying or inferring what laws are applicable.</p>
<p id=x029 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> It is necessary to indicate a location is a country, and that it is interpreted as a jurisdiction. For example, to state that a City is within a Region is within a Country is within EU.</p>
<p id=x030 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> We do not model all granular levels, we can model Region and leave it to the use-cases and regions to decide what they want to call their specific regions (state, city, etc.)</p>
<p id=x031 class="phone s04"><cite>julian:</cite> The term 'Region' can be confusing as there are states, provinces, cantones and other terms associated in different countries</p>
<p id=x032 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> for Jurisdiction, we remove the concept 'Jurisdiction' and use 'Location' categories (e.g. Country). And when it is necessary to indicate a certain location is to be interpreted as an 'applicable jurisdiction' i.e. laws apply, then the property hasApplicableJurisdiction can be used.</p>
<p id=x033 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> to indicate a specific Law is applied, we have the proposal 'hasApplicableLaw'. For example, to indicate a policy adheres to GDPR, use as &lt; Policy hasApplicableLaw GDPR &gt; . This enables use-cases to explicitly acknowledge what law they are adhering to.</p>
<p id=x034 class="phone s04"><cite>julian:</cite> The applicable laws can be inferred from Jurisdiction, so this property is not needed. For example, &lt; Policy hasApplicableJurisdiction Bavaria &gt; . can be used to identify GDPR is applicable 'law'.</p>
<p id=x035 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> The property also exists to express explicitly a law is applicable - if needed. In other cases, one could infer the laws, but it would need the entire chain of information to be present in the KG.</p>
<p id=x036 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> For example, &lt; Bavaria a Region &gt; . &lt; Bavaria insideLocation Germany &gt; . &lt; Germany insideLocation EU &gt; . &lt; EU hasApplicableLaw GDPR &gt; . are all the triples needed to infer Bavaria has GDPR applicable.</p>
<p id=x037 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> At what granularity can location be expressed? For example a shop wants to denote its CCTV's location coverage.</p>
<p id=x038 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> For that there are various vocabularies that exist to specify location and region. E.g. geo-semantic-web vocabs, X,Y co-ordinate based ones</p>
<p id=x039 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> So the shop can specify &lt; Shop hasLocation LOC &gt; &lt; LOC hasXY &quot;(100,200)&quot; &gt; &lt; LOC hasCountry Switzerland &gt; to denote both exact location and country, or the country could be inferred from XY.</p>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Use of Jurisdictions</h3>
<p id=x041 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> The Jurisdictions/Locations are helpful because the Country is needed to be specified for data storage, collection, transfer, etc. And this is necessary to determine legal basis e.g. for data transfers. Therefore, Countries, Adequacy Decisions should be provided by DPV.</p>
<p id=x042 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> Additionally, DPAs are relevant to a region to indicate authorities, and region-specific laws can also be provided (e.g. EU has GDPR) to assist choosing the correct legal bases.</p>
<p id=x043 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> Work for this could look like, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/coolharsh55/dpv-x/blob/master/dpv-jurisdictions/juris.ttl">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>coolharsh55/<wbr>dpv-x/<wbr>blob/<wbr>master/<wbr>dpv-jurisdictions/<wbr>juris.ttl</a></p>
<p id=x044 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> This graph models each country as a Jurisdiction and indicates its DPA and models Adequacy Decisions between countries/EU.</p>
<p id=x045 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> Once the jurisdiction concepts are finalised within the DPV, this is where they would be useful. E.g. ensuring correct data locations, legal basis in ROPA documents.</p>
<p id=x046 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> A 'checklist' for what concepts and resources are needed for DPV v1 is provided here: <a href="https://harshp.com/dev/dpv/dpv-v1-checklist.html">https://<wbr>harshp.com/<wbr>dev/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>dpv-v1-checklist.html</a> Feedback and Suggestions are welcome.</p>
