<section>
<h3 id=t01>dpv-legal external vocabs</h3>
<p id=x010 class=summary>Bert Van Nuffelen suggested using EU vocabularies as an authoritative source for concepts currently in DPV-LEGAL. Namely countries and EU membership.</p>
<p id=x011 class=summary>See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/46">w3c/<wbr>dpv#46</a> for the issue and discussion.</p>
<p id=x012 class=summary>Given that the EU vocabularies are authoritative and well-maintained, we decide to remove these concepts from DPV-LEGAL and use the ones from EU instead.</p>
<p id=x013 class=summary>This means rewriting most of concepts to use EUvoc IRIs, e.g. for expressing laws and authorities and other sources.</p>
<p id=x014 class=summary>If there are other authoritative vocabularies, then alignment is simple given that they all use ISO 3166 codes for countries.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>ISO 27560 Consent Record</h3>
<p id=x016 class=summary>The standard is closing towards stability, with an expected publication date of June 2023.</p>
<p id=x017 class=summary>Once the schema is relatively stable and consensus is reached, DPV will provide a guide on creating consent records based on 27560, along with providing the relevant 'schema' and vocabulary.</p>
<p id=x018 class=summary>An example of how using DPV can be used for the current draft is here - <a href="https://github.com/coolharsh55/dpv-consent-record">coolharsh55/<wbr>dpv-consent-record</a></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Rules</h3>
<p id=x020 class=summary>We discussed the need (and limitation) for simple mechanisms to express rules over DPV defined information.</p>
<p id=x021 class=summary>The proposal is to have <code>hasRule</code> as a relation that takes a target <code>Rule</code>, which may be of type <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, and <code>Obligation</code>. For anything more, we refer to external vocabularies such as ODRL.</p>
<p id=x022 class=summary>These rules can be associated with any <em>block</em> such as PDH's. If they have to be applied over single concepts, e.g. to say data category Identifier is prohibited, then it is tricky to express this.</p>
<p id=x023 class=summary>Because using triple notations, there are two sets of information here - 1) <code>hasPersonalData Identifier</code>; and 2) <code>hasRule Prohibited</code>.</p>
<p id=x024 class=summary>Alternative is to provide specific relations, e.g. as <code>hasProhibition [ hasPersonalData Identifier ]</code> - which is still the same solution with a less elegant expression, no explicit notation of the <em>rule</em>, and requires creating such relations for every type of rule.</p>
<p id=x025 class=summary>Paul has asked for examples (e.g. mailing list) for how the proposed rule expression will work. The next meeting will discuss the examples and decide on rule expression.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Right Exercise</h3>
<p id=x027 class=summary>Rights can be of two types - <code>ActiveRight</code> which means some action must be taken to exercise it, and <code>PassiveRight</code> which means no action needs to be taken as it is always under exercise.</p>
<p id=x028 class=summary>Examples are GDPR (D)SAR or Data Portability being active rights, while right to privacy is a passive (and fundamental) right.</p>
<p id=x029 class=summary>We therefore focus on how to exercise active rights.</p>
<p id=x030 class=summary>georg raised an interesting question - if some information is needed to exercise right, this should be indicated in the notice/record. The appropriate legal basis for this would be legal obligation.</p>
<p id=x031 class=summary>We discussed the use-cases for rights, and tried to identify the key information / concepts.</p>
<p id=x032 class=summary>We have <code>Right</code> and <code>hasRight</code> in DPV. We need a way to indicate how/where to exercise that right.</p>
<p id=x033 class=summary>This can be through a relation <code>isExercisedAt</code> that points to some resource or link where the right exercise can be requested or performed.</p>
<p id=x034 class=summary>To express what is needed for this, such as some information (e.g. email) or technical measure (e.g. authentication) - a PDH instance can be used which provides the framework for describing purposes, processing, personal data, entities associated.</p>
<p id=x035 class=summary>To indicate who made the request, which may not always be the data subject but an authorised party, the relations <code>isMadeBy</code> and <code>isMadeTo</code> were discussed.</p>
<p id=x036 class=summary>Note - we have <code>isIndicatedBy</code> which can be reused here with a complement as <code>isIndicatedTo</code></p>
<p id=x037 class=summary>To indicate the data subject whose right is being exercised, the existing <code>hasDataSubject</code> can be used. As with consent, it may not be necessary to always duplicate informatoin on who indicated and who the data subject if they are the same.</p>
<p id=x038 class=summary>A single access point for rights can handle multiple rights. This can be indicated by using <code>hasRight</code> with all the rights.</p>
<p id=x039 class=summary>To indicate the scope of the request, e.g. a specific purpose or personal data, or a temporal duration, <code>hasScope</code> and <code>Scope</code> can be used.</p>
<p id=x040 class=summary>An open question is how to express the authorisation (relation or information) between Data Subject and the request initiator. We may need to establish a way for these relationships and information.</p>
<p id=x041 class=summary>Rights exercises have stages/events. There is a request by the data subject, then an acknowledgement by the controller, then a response.</p>
<p id=x042 class=summary>Response may be successul exercise of the right, and may contain additional information and/or actions such as download data or view a page.</p>
<p id=x043 class=summary>Response may be failure to exercise right with justification, or an intermediary stage asking for more information or authentication.</p>
<p id=x044 class=summary>An open question for requests - how to express data should be in a specific format, e.g. PDF.</p>
<p id=x045 class=summary>An open question - how to express where information should be communicated, e.g. via emails.</p>
<p id=x046 class=summary>We will circulate ideas/proposals/discussions via the mailing list, and take this up again next week.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Next meeting</h3>
<p id=x048 class=summary>We will meet again in 1 week, on OCT-15 13:00 WEST / 14:00 CEST.</p>
<p id=x049 class=summary>Topics will be Rules and Rights Exercise, with other items on agenda and AOB.</p>
