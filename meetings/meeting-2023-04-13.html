<section>
<h3 id=t01>ISO/IEC 27560 Consent Record</h3>
<p id=x014 class=summary>The ISO/IEC work on 27560 consent records has progressed in stage to final approval with another round of (minor editorial) comments.</p>
<p id=x015 class=summary>One of the appendices has an example of the consent record that uses the DPV for concepts. This is a good news as it represents usefulness of DPV and the work conducted within DPVCG.</p>
<p id=x016 class=summary>A minor change to be suggested for DPV is to change the reference for DPV which currently refers to the draft report, and instead to have it refer to the final published report.</p>
<p id=x017 class=summary>Further work on this will include analysing the 27560 for ensuring all relevant concepts are presentin DPV, resolving any deficiencies found, and then producing a guidance document for implementing 27560 using DPV. More on this will be circulated by harsh in the coming weeks.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>DPVCG Minutes</h3>
<p id=x019 class=summary>The previous minutes have been moved over to GitHub, with the index at new URL <a href="https://w3id.org/dpv/meetings">https://<wbr>w3id.org/<wbr>dpv/<wbr>meetings</a> which includes the minutes as well. This is to enable better searching and use of minutes, such as to find when a concept was last discussed, or identify resolutions or discussions of relevance.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Data Breach concepts</h3>
<p id=x021 class=summary>We continue the discussion on concepts regarding data breaches. The earlier email <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2023Mar/0005.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2023Mar/<wbr>0005.html</a> by harsh provided the set of initial concepts, and another email by georg <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2023Apr/0000.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2023Apr/<wbr>0000.html</a> shared analysis of concepts based on EDPB guidelines for data breaches.</p>
<p id=x022 class=summary>(via shared screen) based on this harsh is proposing identifying the relevant concepts and relations to create a minimal vocabulary consisting of concepts <code>DataBreach</code>, <code>DBIA</code> (Data Breach Impact Assessment) - which includes an investigation of breach and effects; and <code>DataBreachCommunication</code> - which includes notifications.</p>
<p id=x023 class=summary>Next steps include adding concepts from EDPB guidelines for Data Breach (analysis provided by Georg) and expanding the minimal vocabulary; then applying it to DPC's breach reporting form to identify missing bits; and refine and expand as needed. Examples and detailed notes may be shared via the mailing list.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x025 class=summary>We will meet again in one week on 20th April THU at 14:00 WEST / 15:00 CEST at the usual time slot. Agenda items carried over include Data Breach concepts.</p>
