<section>
<h3 id=t01>Optionality Expressed at what 'level'?</h3>
<p id=x013 class=summary>Georg raised the question as to at what level is <code>optionality</code> expressed e.g. how deep/high</p>
<p id=x014 class=summary>This is relevant for e.g. in a privacy notice the data is indicated to be optional at the top or somewhere in contents</p>
<p id=x015 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> This is dependant on use-cases, any level is possible as use-cases have all kinds of requirements. So it can be used at any level.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Recipient Country vs Entity Country</h3>
<p id=x019 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Georg raised the question as to how to distinguish/define the location (country) of recipient as opposed to that of entity</p>
<p id=x020 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Recipient location as in location of server, processing, etc. is defined has processing (e.g. Storage) and hasLocation it</p>
<p id=x021 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Entity location is defined as location property on that Entity</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>Jurisdictional Concepts</h3>
<p id=x025 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Julian raised the topic of representing German federal states and laws as jurisdictional concepts following earlier proposal from harsh<br>
<span id=x026>… In this, the Bavarian region has two DPAs for public and non-public organisations respectively</span></p>
<p id=x028 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Suggestion is to simply name them as such e.g. DPA-public and DPA-non-public<br>
<span id=x029>… For state names, it is recommended to follow existing norms or taxonomies e.g. ISO-3166 or EU or countrie's own standardised forms for state names</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Consequence as concept</h3>
<p id=x035 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> Overlap with ODRL<br>
<span id=x036>… ODRL has the property <code>consequence</code> which links a <code>Duty</code> to itself, and is a sub-property of <code>failure</code>, thereby restricting its use in conditions where the consequences are always <code>negative</code>.</span><br>
<span id=x037>… In DPV, the requirement is to broadly specify the consequence of an action, which can be both <code>positive</code> and <code>negative</code></span><br>
<span id=x038>… Therefore, DPV will declare its own concept, as it cannot adopt the exact inference of ODRL's concepts in this case</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Type of Consequence</h3>
<p id=x044 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> We discussed <code>Consequence</code> as the existence concept, and the requirement to express whether such consequences are <code>positive</code> or <code>negative</code>.<br>
<span id=x045>… For this, two sets of options were proposed: <code>Success/Failure</code> and <code>Materialisation/NonMaterialisation</code></span><br>
<span id=x046>… Of these, <code>Success/Failure</code> were selected based on less ambiguity, more clarity, and intuitiveness</span><br>
<span id=x047>… Concepts added: <code>ConsequenceOfSuccess</code> and <code>ConsequenceOfFailure</code></span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t06>Benefits and Beneficiary</h3>
<p id=x059 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> These concepts were proposed in the first DPVCG meeting / workshop as relevant to determine who <code>benefits</code> from processing<br>
<span id=x060>… Proposals consisted of concepts <code>Benefits</code> and <code>Beneficiary</code> with the properties <code>hasBenefits</code> and <code>hasBeneficiary</code></span><br>
<span id=x061>… In subsequent discussions, it was agreed that the scope should be broader to also include the <code>opposite</code> of benefits and beneficiary</span><br>
<span id=x062>… Examples proposed included: <code>Detriment</code> and <code>Harm</code></span><br>
<span id=x063>… The group discussed the notion of <code>benefit</code> being a type of <code>consequence</code> and whether it can subsequently be modelled as such</span><br>
<span id=x064>… Additionally, <code>beneficiary</code> would be the <code>entity impacted by a consequence</code> thereby avoiding the need to explicitly declare beneficiary as a concept</span><br>
<span id=x065>… Further discussions related the notion of <code>Impact</code> as being distinct from <code>Consequence</code> e.g. PersonalDataBreach has the consequence leaked data which then has an impact of identity theft or scams</span><br>
<span id=x066>… Proposed pattern: X --hasConsequence (neg. isConsequenceFrom) ⟶ Consequence ⟶ hasImpactOn ⟶ Y</span><br>
<span id=x067>… Proposed pattern: Consequence --hasImpact⟶ Impact --hasImpactOn⟶ Y</span><br>
<span id=x068>… The group agreed the need for further discussion and examples. Harsh will circulate email with a proposal.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t07>Other Proposed Concepts</h3>
<p id=x073 class="phone s01"><cite>harsh:</cite> <code>hasResponsibleEntity</code> - specifying what entity is responsible for something e.g. a controller in a joint controller relationship, or a specific department/division within the organisation (accepted)<br>
<span id=x074>… <code>OrganisationalUnit</code> - specifying an unit within an organisation, with the criteria that the unit does not constitute as a separate legal entity in the sense of data controller, data processor, etc. (accepted)</span><br>
<span id=x075>… <code>InternationalOrganisation</code> - As defined in GDPR Art.4-26, and whether this definition is sufficient for a global scope. We invite proposals, otherwise we go with this definition. (conditionally accepted)</span></p>
