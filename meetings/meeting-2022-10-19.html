<h2>Meeting minutes</h2>
<section><p id=x008 class=summary><a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/10/05-dpvcg-minutes.html">Previous minutes</a></p>
<p id=x009 class="phone s01"><cite>paul:</cite> Working on using DPV and DPCat for ROPA-based tools, with a questionnaire to understand uses. Will share with DPVCG when ready for feedback.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t01>Use-cases, Requirements, and Examples</h3>
<p id=x012 class="phone s01"><cite>paul:</cite> see email <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Oct/0003.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Oct/<wbr>0003.html</a><br>
<span id=x013>… These will be moved to the main repo, along with additional functionality that links examples in the tables for relevant concepts within specs</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t02>Discussion on rules</h3>
<p id=x015 class="phone s01"><cite>paul:</cite> See previous minutes for reference and overview</p>
<p id=x016 class="phone s02"><cite>georg:</cite> Where should the rules be expressed? Does everything (e.g. each PersonalDataHandling) have to be explicitly declared as permission and prohibition?</p>
<p id=x019 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> Default is that something is permitted which we implicitly are using currently, so we can explicitly say something is not permitted. But for contexts such as recording a decision for consent, you can explicitly denote permissions and prohibitions to reflect what the user has expressed to indicate a complete decision from choices. Though typically a record only contains the decision rather than all choices.<br>
<span id=x020>… See beatriz's email - <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Oct/0006.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Oct/<wbr>0006.html</a> regarding creating equivalent ODRL policies for rules expressed in DPV</span><br>
<span id=x021>… Since there are no specific queries regarding rules, we accept them for inclusion within the spec.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t03>DPV v1 release</h3>
<p id=x027 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> We had invited comments until OCT-15, and we received a few major as well as minor comments. Most have been address (ref. mailing list and GitHub issues), with some still pending - such as dpv-tech and Cloud computing concepts.<br>
<span id=x028>… However, no issues identified that are 'blocking' the release.</span><br>
<span id=x029>… We discussed and set NOV-15 as the date for release, to have it published in time for dissemination before the christmas break and to indicate 'stability' in the current work while continuing to enhance it.</span><br>
<span id=x030>… We discussed what is 'missing' from the current set of concepts in DPV, namely - rights, data breaches, and data transfers. We agreed that rather than wait to finish these concepts, we will continue with the v1 release, and add them as per their condition at the time.</span><br>
<span id=x031>… For example, if the concepts have been accepted, they will be added while documentation may be pending. If the concepts are still being explored, a note to the effect and their proposed status will be added (e.g. appendix). This is to indicate that while the concepts are not present in the spec, they are being worked upon.</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t04>Exercising Rights</h3>
<p id=x037 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> See email - <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dpvcg/2022Oct/0004.html">https://<wbr>lists.w3.org/<wbr>Archives/<wbr>Public/<wbr>public-dpvcg/<wbr>2022Oct/<wbr>0004.html</a> regarding concepts representing exercising of rights, responses, status, and provenance of activities.<br>
<span id=x038>… We will take this up in the next meeting specifically to go over the examples. In this meeting, we discussed the concepts regarding exercising rights.</span><br>
<span id=x039>… beatriz has proposed - <a href="https://github.com/w3c/dpv/issues/63">w3c/<wbr>dpv#63</a> to add <code>RightExemption</code> as a concept to represent the cases where a right cannot be fulfilled</span><br>
<span id=x040>… We discussed and agreed on the term <code>RightNonFulfilmentJustification</code> as a type of <code>Justification</code> to indicate why a right could not be fulfilled. This is to avoid the phrase &quot;right exemption&quot; which would be interpreted as saying an exemption to providing the right.</span><br>
<span id=x041>… In cases where the right cannot be fulfilled, the appropriate status (e.g. RightNotFulfilled) and a justification (i.e. RightNonFulfilmentJustification) would be used. Examples from beatriz's list include (Art.13/Art.14/etc.) - Data subject already has been provided this information, Confidentiality breach, and so on.</span></p>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Additional discussion and notes</h3>
<p id=x051 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> Systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons - from GDPR's DPIA 35.3a can be a list of SKOS concepts that suggest what other concepts are relevant to interpret this (complex) concept. Need to figure out how to provide such a list.<br>
<span id=x052>… DPV-PD - adding CriminalOffense as subtype of Criminal</span><br>
<span id=x053>… DPV-GDPR - adding Proportionality, SystematicExtensiveEvaluationOfPersonalAspects</span><br>
<span id=x054>… Risk - New category of consequences related to ConsequenceOnDataSecurity and new category for ConsequenceForDataSubject and ImpactOnDataSubject</span><br>
<span id=x055>… OrgMeasure - new concepts for reviewing validity, effectiveness, etc. - with specific types for ReviewImpactAssessmentConformance and ReviewImpactAssessmentAdequacy ; adding ConsultationWithDataSubjectRepresentative for DPIA</span><br>
<span id=x056>… Lawfulness as a specific compliance sub type for legal compliance, with types Lawful, Unlawful, and LawfulnessUnknown ; with variations for GDPR as GDPRLawfulness, GDPRCompliant, and so on</span><br>
<span id=x057>… ConformanceStatus as a specific type to indicate conformance (as distinct from compliance), with types Conformant and NonConformant</span><br>
<span id=x058>… DPIA outcomes in terms of processing recommendations as DPIARecommendsProcessingContinue and DPIARecommendsProcessingNotContinue</span><br>
<span id=x059>… DPIA adherence expressed as DPIAConformity with specific types</span></p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id=t06>Next Meeting</h3>
<p id=x062 class="phone s03"><cite>harsh:</cite> We will meet again in 1 week, on OCT-26 WED 13:00 WEST / 14:00 CEST<br>
<span id=x063>… Topics will be continued discussion on rights, with specifically focusing on the examples shared on mailing list and representing GDPR's rights</span></p>
